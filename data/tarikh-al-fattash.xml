<head>History of the <rs type="ethnic">Songai</rs> kings of the <roleName>chî</roleName> dynasty and especially of <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Ali</persName>.</head>
<p>It is now time for us to return to our subject, which is the biography of the askia. We have dwelt on all these characters1, thus following a path which it was not in our designs to follow; there was indeed no result to be obtained from it, since it is almost certainly the case that the major part of the preceding accounts is fictitious. We ask God the Most High for his forgiveness.
Lord, be praised and glorified! I declare that there is no other god but you, I ask your forgiveness and return to you.</p>

<p>After the <roleName>chî</roleName> <persName>Bâro-Dal-Yombo</persName>2 reigned the <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Mâdogo</persName>3, then <persName>the <roleName>chî</roleName> Mohammed-Koûkiya</persName>, then <persName>the <roleName>chî</roleName> Mohammed-Fâri</persName>, then <persName>the <roleName>chî</roleName> Balma</persName>, then <persName>the <roleName>chî</roleName> Souleïmân-Dâma</persName>5, who, according to some versions, was called Dândi.
The latter was the ancestor of the inhabitants of the city of <placeName>Arham</placeName>.6

This is the dynastic title that the <title>Tarikh es-Soudân</title> spells <foreign>sonni</foreign> and of which the variants <foreign>soun</foreign>, <foreign>sin</foreign>, <foreign>tyin</foreign>, etc., are found. The dynasty of the <roleName>chî</roleName> or <roleName>sonni</roleName>, descended from that of the <foreign>diâ</foreign> or <foreign>zâ</foreign> which had preceded it, reigned in <placeName>Gâo</placeName> from 1335 to 1493. It seems, from the testimony of <persName>Leo the African</persName>, that these two dynasties were of Berber origin; Marmol and Barth shared this opinion.</note>

It was he who defeated the people of the province of <placeName>Mîma</placeName>1, sacked their territory (<ref target="arpage43"/>) and annihilated their power. Previously this province formed a great kingdom, of formidable power, which had broken away from the empire of <placeName>Malli</placeName>. There were in the <placeName>Mîma</placeName> twelve great chiefs, of whom the principal was the <persName>Mîma-kono</persName>2. Among the other princes of the <placeName>Mîma</placeName> was the <persName>Toukifiri-sôma</persName>3; before him the king of the
<placeName>Mâssina</placeName> had to stand and cover himself with dust as he swore loyalty to him and took off his boubou4 and then draped himself in it; traces of his capital, ruined today, can still be seen. The title of this prince has continued to the present day, but he who now bears it has fallen away and is obliged to go on foot, having no mount; his authority has disappeared, but his title has remained (praise be to the eternal Sovereign!). The king of <placeName>Mâssina</placeName> goes to visit this personage still, claiming that it brings him good luck; he consults him and asks him to pray for him; he dismounts his mount to greet him and goes to find him in the place where his now ruined capital once stood.</p>

<p>
The successor of <persName>Silmân-Dâma</persName> was the tyrant, the debauchee, the accursed, the oppressor, <persName>the <roleName>chî</roleName> Ali</persName>5, the last king of this

None of his armies was ever routed: always victorious, never defeated. He left no region, no town, no village, from the land of <placeName>Kanta</placeName>1 to <placeName>Sibiridougou</placeName>, without attacking it
at the head of his cavalry, warring against the inhabitants and ravaging their territory.</p>

<p>The meaning of this word <roleName>chî</roleName> is thus given, according to a text which I have seen, written in the hand of <persName>Mahmûd</persName>,2 one of our imâms:

The <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Ali</persName> was a tyrannical king, so hard-hearted that he sometimes had a child thrown into a mortar and forced the mother to pound it, the latter having to pound her child while it was still alive; the flesh was then fed to the horses. He was debauched and impious, so much so that one of the sheikhs of his time, inhabiting <placeName>Môri-Koïra</placeName>, was asked whether this prince was a Muslim or an infidel, his actions being those of an infidel although he pronounced the double profession of Muslim faith and spoke as one well versed in the things of religion.</p>


<p>See, from his deeds, what his impiety was: he had jurisconsults put to death! And how many villages he destroyed, causing their inhabitants to perish in the flames! He inflicted

Tarikh es-Soudan, translation, pp. 258-261). <persName>Mahmûd Kâti</persName> had been dead for about a month at that time.

The people of his time and his soldiers had given him the nickname of <addName>Dâli</addName> as an honorary title and whenever he called out to someone, they would reply, <quote><addName>Dâli</addName> !</quote> One of our friends, <persName>Mohammed <rs type="ethnic">Wangara</rs> ben Abdallah ben Sandioûka El-Foulâni</persName>1 (God have mercy on him!) told me that he had heard it said by <persName>Aboulabbâs Sîdi Ahmed ben Anda-ag-Mohammed</persName> (God have mercy on him! ): <quote>It is not lawful to give such a nickname to anyone, for this word means <gloss>the most high</gloss>2 and must be reserved for the Master of all power, who is God the most high.</quote> The same is true of <foreign>Doûlinta</foreign> those who say <foreign>Doûrinta</foreign> commit a fault - an expression which means <gloss>the slave of the Master</gloss>3: now, by "Master" who used this expression meant the chî4 (the curse of God (<ref target="arpage45"/>) be upon him!). As for this term <foreign>Dâli</foreign>, it is used today only when addressing the <roleName><placeName>Koûma</placeName>-koï</roleName>5 and the <roleName><placeName>Dienné</placeName>-koï</roleName>.

<note n="3">In today's <rs type="ethnic">Songai</rs> language "the slave of the master" can expressed <foreign>doû-ditam</foreign>.</note>

<note n="4">The author probably means that the slaves or servants of the <roleName>chî</roleName> were given the appellation of slaves of the Master, which amounted to conferring on the <roleName>chî</roleName> a title that belongs only to God, such as that of <quote>Most High</quote>.</note>

<p>This <roleName>chî</roleName> spent his entire reign in warlike expeditions: he had royal residences at <placeName>Koûkiya</placeName>1, at <placeName>Gâo</placeName> and at <placeName>Kabara</placeName>2; the latter was called <placeName>Tila</placeName>; he had yet another at <placeName>Wara</placeName><ref target="p.104n4"/>in the province of <placeName>Dirma</placeName>5: this one was in the vicinity of the city of <placeName>Ankaba</placeName>6 and faced the city of <placeName>Diendiao</placeName>7; but he did not stay in any of them. The <roleName>chî</roleName> who had preceded him resided in <placeName>Koûkiya</placeName>, but the <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Ali</persName>, this scoundrel, was constantly on expeditions.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his reign, he had gone to the city of <placeName>Dîreï</placeName>8.  Then, having had news of the king of <rs type="ethnic">the Môssi</rs> named <persName><persName>Komdâo</persName></persName>9, he left <placeName>Dîreï</placeName> to put himself in a position to meet him,

-- The <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Ali</persName> having then left <placeName>Dîrei</placeName>, the two adversaries met at <placeName>Kobi</placeName>1.</p>

<p>
It was in the year 873 that the city of <placeName>Timbuktu</placeName> was sacked by <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Ali</persName>, who entered it on the fourth day of the month of redjeb (18 January 1469).

<note n="1">If we count the number of times that the month of Ramadan recurred from the advent of the <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Ali</persName> until the time of his presence in <placeName>Sâma</placeName>, we find that thirteen to fourteen lunar years elapsed between these two periods;
the coming of the prince having taken place in the year 869 of the hegira, it is therefore appropriate to place his presence in Sâma in the year 882-883, i.e. from 1477 to 1479 of our era. This is quite consistent with the indications of the <title>Tarikh es-Soudân</title>, which places the arrival of <roleName>the <rs type="ethnic">Môssi</rs> emperor</roleName> at <placeName>Sâma</placeName> in 1477 and at <placeName>Bîrou</placeName> (<placeName>Walata</placeName>) in 1480, and then places the battle of <placeName>Kobi</placeName> in 1483. There are ambiguities and contradictions in the above account, which may be due to the fact that one part of the account was written by the grandson while the other was borrowed from the work of his grandfather. Thus, he relates the affair of <placeName>Kobi</placeName> twice, seeming to place it first at the beginning of the reign of <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Ali</persName> and before the expedition of <rs type="ethnic">the Môssi</rs> to <placeName>Walata</placeName>, only to place it some fifteen years later; it is possible that, with regard to the stay that the <roleName>chî</roleName> made in <placeName>Dîreï</placeName> at the beginning of his reign, the author had anticipated the events by telling that it was from this locality that the prince was later to leave to go to <placeName>Kobi</placeName> to meet<roleName>the emperor of <rs type="ethnic">the Môssi</rs></roleName>. As for the present paragraph, it should probably be interpreted as follows: <rs type="ethnic">the Môssi</rs> marched on <placeName>Walata</placeName>, having left the baggage and family of their chief in <placeName>Dîreï</placeName>; the <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Ali</persName>, who was in 
<placeName type="region">the Niger buckle</placeName>, set out on their tracks, arrived in the <rs type="ethnic">Bambara</rs> countries after their passage, put to death the chief of <placeName>Sila</placeName> to punish him for not having stopped them, then, having given up reaching them, went to <placeName>Dîreï</placeName> and seized the luggage and the household of their chief; the latter, during that time, had attacked and plundered <placeName>Walata</placeName> and returned to his country; on arriving near the <placeName type="river">Niger</placeName>, he learned that the <roleName>chî</roleName> had seized his goods and his family, marched to meet him, was taken by fear when he saw his numerous army and resumed his march towards the south-east without pushing on to <placeName>Dîreï</placeName>; it is then that the <roleName>chî</roleName>, taking advantage of the disarray of his adversary, set out in pursuit and reached him at <placeName>Kobi</placeName>.

Some did not even take supper with them that night, others did not take blankets to sleep on; some left on foot although they had horses in their houses, but they left them there for fear that the time to saddle them would delay them.

As for me, I hardly believe that such a thing was possible and I do not think that <persName>El-Haddjâdj ben Yoûssof</persName>1, in spite of his ardour to shed blood and his cruelty towards all, ever did anything similar to what was then done in <placeName>Timbuktu</placeName> nor that he saw his orders so punctually executed.</p>

When the <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Ali</persName> had set out for the purpose of attacking <placeName>Dienné</placeName>, he had arrived at a village in the region named <placeName>Chîtaï</placeName>. The

The ferocity of <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Ali</persName> towards the Muslims and his cruelty in all circumstances, whether it was a question of worldly things or those of religion, had become such that the courts were overflowing with sadness and concern. People despaired of ever achieving deliverance, for his reign had lasted so long that they had lost all hope of the day when these evils would cease and end. However, this day came at last, thanks to a poor holy man, whose daughter had been stolen by the king.</p>

<p>This unfortunate man came to the prince's house to explain his grievances, and the prince swore that he would have him thrown into the fire if he did not leave his presence immediately.

<p>
One of these ministers, the Dirma-koë of whom we have just spoken, swore that he would not fail to kill the scholar Sâlih Diawara, an envoy of the askia prince, adding: "If you do not have this scholar put to death, the askia will not cease to dispatch envoys to you; if, on the contrary, you have him put to death, the askia will not continue to to send them to you". But God prevented him from carrying out this plan and the <roleName>chî</roleName>, addressing himself to Sâlih Diawara, said to him: "Return to the one who sent you; but, if a new messenger comes to me on his behalf, let the blood of this messenger fall on your head. Tell the askia who sent you that he should prepare himself for the fight that is going to take place between him and me; tell him that I do not accept his proposals and that I will never accept them."</p>

<p>
The scholar Sâlih Diawara returned to the prince, reported to him the words of the <roleName>chî</roleName> <persName>Bâro</persName> and made known to him the dispositions of spirit of the latter and the energy with which the <roleName>chî</roleName> had refused before him to embrace Islamism.
When Sâlih Diawara had informed the askia of what he had witnessed during his meeting with the <roleName>chî</roleName> <persName>Bâro</persName>, the prince gathered his council, composed of the ulama, the notables and the chiefs of his army, and he consulted them on the point of knowing what he should do: to engage in the fight with the <roleName>chî</roleName> <persName>Bâro</persName> or to send him a third envoy? All were of the opinion that he should send a third envoy who, by using diplomacy, would try to soften the <roleName>chî</roleName>; perhaps then God would bring this one back to the right way and make him embrace Islam.</p>

<p>It was then that the askia sent me, the humble believer, the  <roleName>alfa</roleName> Kâti, to the <roleName>chî</roleName>. So I went to him and found him in the town of Anfao, which is near Gâo. I gave him the message of the askia, prince of the believers, and I spoke to him with as much courtesy as possible, as the askia <persName><roleName>El-Hâdj</roleName> Mohammed</persName>, prince of the believers, had recommended to me. I spoke kindly to him in the hope that God would bring him back to the right path. But he refused to listen to my advice, became angry, ordered the drum to be beaten immediately and began to gather his troops, scolding and storming in order to intimidate me, while I applied to myself the words of the poet: "I will ensure today by my death the triumph over the cross and its worshippers".</p>

<p>
At the same time, his troops massed around him like a mountain range (<ref target="arpage55"/>), raising clouds of dust that made the day seem like night, and began to shout loudly, swearing that blood would flow freely.</p>

<p>Then I returned and told him what had happened. The askia <persName><roleName>El-Hâdj</roleName> Mohammed</persName>, prince of the believers, immediately made his preparations, ordering the drum to be beaten and his troops to gather around him immediately. All his men swore to remain faithful to him until death.</p>

<p>Then he mounted his horse and, at the head of his victorious army, rode in the direction of <roleName>chî</roleName> Bảro. The two troops met on Monday, the 24th of the month of Jomâda II. Between the time when the askia, prince of the believers, had sent his [first] message to the <roleName>chî</roleName> Bảro and the time of

the meeting of their two armies, fifty-two days had passed.
</p>


<p>A violent battle ensued between the two troops. God came to the aid of the askia against the <roleName>chî</roleName> <persName>Bâro</persName>, whose soldiers were routed and suffered such terrible losses that they believed that they were all going to perish and that the end of the world
had arrived. <persName><roleName>The Dendi-fâri</roleName> Afoumba</persName>, who was next to the <roleName>chî</roleName> <persName>Bâro</persName> and who was a very brave man, threw himself that day into the River, where he died.</p>

<p>As for <persName><roleName>El-Hâdj</roleName> Mohammed</persName>, he had with him <persName><roleName>the mansa</roleName> Kûra</persName>, son of <persName><roleName>the mansa</roleName> Mûsa</persName>, of which it was spoken before, but he was accompanied by none of the other kings of Tekroûr nor of Songaï, none having answered his call
except for this one.</p>

<p>When God had routed the troops of <roleName>chî</roleName> <persName>Bâro</persName>, he fled alone to Ayorou1, where he remained until his death, while the very fortunate, the very orthodox2 seized power and became the prince of the believers and the khalifa of the Muslims.</p>

<p>
Thus God made the askia <persName><roleName>El-Hâdj</roleName> Mohammed</persName> inherit all the territory of the <persName>Bâro</persName> <roleName>chî</roleName>, a territory which extended from <placeName>Kanta</placeName> to <placeName>Sibiridougou</placeName>3, and this prince found himself becoming the master of twenty-four tribes which consisted of slaves of the <roleName>chî</roleName> and not of free men reduced to slavery.4</p>

<p>We shall enumerate, God willing, the names of these tribes. Three of them were among the pagan tribes of the Bambara. The first was related to the descendants of Diara Koré Boukar, while the second had its origin in Ngaratibi1 and the third came from Kassambara. (<persName>The <roleName>chî</roleName> Bâro</persName> had inherited these tribes from his father <persName>the <roleName>chî</roleName>
Ali</persName>, who had inherited them in the same way from the <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Souleïmân-Dâma</persName>,
to whom some give the name of <persName>Dândi</persName>. In the same way the latter had inherited them from the <roleName>chî</roleName> Balma, this one from the <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Mohammed-Fâri</persName>, this one from the <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Mohammed-Koûkiya</persName>: In the same way the latter had inherited them from the <roleName>chî</roleName> Mâdogo, who, himself, had seized them on the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName> .</p>

<p>These tribes in fact had become vassals of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName> at the time when the ancestors of the latter had increased their power and after having held the [first] <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName> themselves under their authority. Later, God having brought down the power of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName> to the benefit of the <roleName>chî</roleName> Mâdogo, the latter ravaged the empire of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName>, took their children into captivity, seized all their property, and took away from them the property of these twenty-four tribes.</p>

<p>As for the (<ref target="arpage56"/>) three of these tribes (of which we have spoken above), they were among the domestic serfs of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName>. Since they belonged to the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName>, the custom was that none of the men of these tribes could marry until the king had given 40,000

<p>These three tribes in question descended from a common primitive stock, [their ancestors] having had the same father, called Béma Tâsso, and the same mother, named Arbaa Kalé, so that they were all three brothers of father and mother. A quarrel broke out between them about a woman that all three wanted to marry, and they came to hate each other so much that they ceased to consider themselves of the same blood. They derived their origin from <placeName>Kassambara</placeName> and their village, which was called <placeName>Niani</placeName>, was part of the territory of the <placeName>Malli</placeName> and was the capital of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName>.2</p>

<p>
From the time of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName>, and since these tribes belonged to them, they were bound to an annual payment of forty cubits [of land to be developed] by each couple, husband and wife; so it was until these tribes had passed into the hand of the <roleName>chî</roleName>. In the time of the <roleName>chî</roleName>, from the first of these rulers who was their master until the last, that is to say, until the <persName><roleName>chî</roleName> Ali</persName>, the service was thus regulated: the people were gathered together in groups of a hundred, men and women together, and the <roleName>chî</roleName> made each group measure two hundred cubits on the ground; the people then gathered to the sound of drums and flutes and ploughed the land for him, shouting in the manner of ploughmen while the drums were beaten; when the time of harvest came, the produce of these fields was divided by the <roleName>chî</roleName> among his

soldiers, and, if the harvest was nil, he struck the people with an imposition and made them responsible for it.</p>

<p>When <persName><roleName>the askia</roleName> Muhammad</persName> had become the master of these tribes, he fixed the benefit thus: every year, at harvest time, he sent a man from his entourage to collect the produce of the harvest; if anyone was able to give ten measures of flour1, they took it from him; if anyone could give twenty measures, they took it from him, and so on up to thirty measures, without exceeding this figure, which was the limit that was never crossed, even if the taxpayer would have been able to provide a thousand measures. <persName><roleName>The askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName> also took from these people some of their children and used them to buy horses.2</p>

<p>As for the fourth of the twenty-four tribes of which we have spoken, it was the tribe of the people called <rs type="ethnic">Tyindikèta</rs> (<ref target="arpage57"/>), from a word which, in their language, means <gloss>cutter of grass</gloss>.3 Their work, from the time of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName> until the time of the <roleName>chî</roleName>, consisted in cutting grass for the horses. When they passed into the hands of <persName><roleName>the askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName>, the latter maintained this custom, for he found that they were good only for tending horses. However <persName><roleName>the askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName> imposed a new obligation on them, enjoining the adults to make dugouts which the young boys employed as grooms would make use of for the service of the horses.4 <persName><roleName>The askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName> did indeed take from this tribe a number of young boys to whom he had his horses groomed, wherever he found them from <placeName>Gâo</placeName> to <placeName>Sibiridougou</placeName>.</p>

<p>The fifth tribe was <rs type="ethnic">the Zendji</rs>1.

It consisted, for those who were able to provide them, of ten packages of dried fish; for those who could provide only nine, it was of nine; for those who could provide only seven, it was of seven, and so on until only one packet for those who could provide only one, each one paying according to his means, without however that the royalty could never exceed ten packets.</p>


<p>Whenever anyone came to the prince to ask for a boat, he provided it by taking from the people of that tribe a dugout canoe with its crew.</p>


<p><persName><roleName>The askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName> in fact had taken and reserved these people for his service and that of the people of his house, not allowing anyone to employ them or sell them. He reserved this right for himself and his children, but made an exception for the <persName><rs type="ethnic">Hasanid</rs> <roleName>sheriff</roleName> Es-Seqli</persName>, who was a descendant of <persName>Ali</persName>. When this sheriff went to <placeName>Gâo</placeName> and found <persName><roleName>the askia</roleName> Muhammad</persName> there, the latter gave him all the descendants of a <rs type="ethnic">Zendji</rs> called <persName>Faran-Taka</persName>2, who were at that time 2,700 in number.3 The prince made this gift to the sheriff because he belonged to the descendants of the Prophet (God shower his blessings on him and grant him salvation!) and to show his affection for him. In the biography of <persName><roleName>the askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName>, we will talk in detail, God willing, about

this liberality, as well as of the division of the Zendji which were attributed partly to this sheriff and partly to other characters.</p>

<p>The sixth tribe consisted of the people called Arbi1. These provided the servants of the prince, the members of his household and his servants; their daughters were employed in the service of his wives. They also farmed for him and his children. The young men of the tribe escorted him in arms, marching before and behind him in war as in ordinary times; he employed them as messengers for his special missions. The people of this tribe were exclusively attached to the service of the prince and that is why they were not required to pay royalties in kind.</p>

<p>As for the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh tribes, which were tribes of blacksmiths, they were the tribes of the Diam-Téné, the Diam-Wali, the Sorobanna, [of the Komé] and of the Samatséko. These five tribes were all descended from the same father. This father was a blacksmith, (<ref target="arpage58"/>) a slave of the Christians, who had fled from the islands of the Atlantic Ocean and had come to <placeName>Koûkiya</placeName>, capital of the <roleName>chî</roleName>, at the time of the <roleName>chî</roleName> Mohammed-Fâri. This slave, whose name was Boukar, married a slave of Nâna-Salam, mother of the aforementioned <roleName>chî</roleName>. This slave, who was called Matabala, gave him five male children: Téné, who was the father of the Diam-Téné tribe; Wali, who was the father of the Diam-Wali tribe; Sorobanna, who was the father of the Sorobanna tribe; Komé, who was the father of the Komé tribe, and Samatséko, who was the father of the Samatséko tribe, these tribes attaching their genealogies to their fathers.3</p>

<p>The father of these five children was a cruel, rude, depraved, authoritarian, ignorant, tyrannical and violent man.
He and his sons engaged in robbery, cutting off roads, murdering people, taking them prisoner or robbing them. Complaints about them were brought to the then reigning <roleName>chî</roleName>, who sent a small troop against them with the order to kill the father and seize the children, the latter being his slaves since they were the sons of one of his slaves. The father was killed and the five sons were brought to the <roleName>chî</roleName>, who distributed them among different cities to prevent them from meeting again and repeating their misdeeds. Each of them had numerous descendents.</p>

<p>The dues of these five tribes, from the time of the <roleName>chî</roleName> until the time of <persName><roleName>the askia</roleName> Muhammad</persName>, were one hundred spears and one hundred arrows per each family per year.</p>

<p>As for the twelfth tribe, which was that of the Kurunkoi4 that one meets from <placeName>Gâo</placeName> to the city of Fâni2, it originated in the country of Sôma , which borders their [present] territory
 without being however very close to it4.  It is an offshoot of the Samatséko tribe, because it descends from the sons of the daughter of Samatséko.</p>

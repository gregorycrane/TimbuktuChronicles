you are in grievous error They say If we had listened been wise we should not now have been suffering the punishment of the Omniscient So they confess they have sinned in destroying the followers of the Omniscient Those who fear their Lord profess his name they receive pardon great honor Guard your words ye wicked make it known that God is allwise in all his manifestations Do you not know from the creation that God is full of skill that He has made for you the way of error you have walked therein have chosen to live upon what your god Nasr has furnished you Believe on Him who dwells in heaven who has fitted the earth to be your support it shall give you food Believe on Him who dwells in Heaven who has sent you a prophet you shall understand what a teacher He has sent you Those that were before them deceived them in regard to their prophet And how came they to reject him Did they not see in the heavens above them how the fowls of the air receive with pleasure that which is sent them God looks after all Believe ye it is He who supplies your wants that you may take

O Sheikh Hunter I cannot write my life because I have forgotten much of my own language, as well as <corr>of</corr> the Arabic. Do not be hard upon me, my brother. To God let many thanks be paid for his great mercy &amp; goodness.

Page 14 

In the name of God the Gracious, the Merciful.— Thanks be to God, supreme in goodness &amp; kindness, &amp; grace who is worthy of all honor, who created all things for his service, even man's power of action of speech. 

From Omar to Sheikh Hunter 

You asked me to write my life. I am not able to do this because I have much forgotten my own, as well as the Arabic language. Neither can I write very grammatically or according to the true idiom. And so my brother, I beg you, in God's name, not to chide me, for I am a man of weak eyes, &amp; of a weak body My name is Omar ibn Seid. <note>(son of Seid)</note>

My birthplace was Fut Tûr <note resp="different-hand" rend="superscript">Fouta Toro</note>, between the two rivers. <note>(Mesopotamia in Africa?)</note> I sought knowledge under the instruction of <corr resp="2">a</corr> Sheikh called Mohammed Seid, my own brother, &amp; Sheikh Soleiman Kembeh, &amp; Sheikh Gabriel Abdal. I continued my studies twenty five years, &amp; then returned to my home where I remained six years. Then there came to our place a large army who killed many men, &amp; took me, &amp; brought me to the great sea, &amp; sold me into the hands of the Christians <corr resp="1">who bound me</corr> &amp; sent me on board a great ship &amp; <corr>we</corr> sailed upon the great sea a month &amp; a half when we came to a place called Charleston in the Christian language. There they sold me to a small, weak, &amp; wicked man called Johnson, a complete infidel, who had no fear of God at all. Now I am a small man, &amp; unable to do hard work so I fled from <note n="1">the hand of</note> Johnson &amp; after a month came to a place called Faydil <note>(Fayetteville?)</note> Here I saw some great houses <note>(churches)</note>. On the new moon I went into a church to pray. A lad saw me &amp; rode off to the place of his father &amp; informed him that he had seen a black man in the church. A

man named Handah <note>(Hunter?)</note> &amp; another man with him on horseback came attended by a troop of dogs. They took me &amp; made me go with them twelve miles to a place called Fayd-il<note>(?)</note> where they put me into a great house from which I could not go out. I continued in the great house (which in the Christian language they called <hi rend="underlin">jail</hi>) sixteen days &amp; nights. One Friday the jailor came &amp; opened the door of the house &amp;  I saw a great many men all Christians, some of whom called out to me "what is your name? Is it Omar or Seid?" I did not understand their Christian language. A man called Bob Mumford took me <corr>&amp;  led me</corr> out of the jail, &amp;  I was very well pleased to go with them to their place. I staid at Mumford's four days nights, &amp; then a man named Jim Owen, son in law of Mumford, who married his daughter Betsey asked me if I was willing to go to a place called Bladen. <note>(B. Co. N.C.)</note> I said, Yes. I was willing. I went with them &amp; have remained in the place <note>(house?)</note> of Jim Owen until now.</p>

<p>Before after I came into the hand of Gen Owen

a man by the name of Mitchell came to buy me. He asked me if I were willing to go to Charleston City. I said "no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I not willing to go to Charleston. I stay in the hand of Jim Owen." O ye people of N. Carolina, O ye people of S. Carolina, O ye people of America, all of you have you among you any two such men as Jim Owen &amp; John Owen. These men are good men. What food they eat they give to me to eat. As they clothe themselves they clothe me. They permit me to read the gospel of God, our Lord Saviour &amp; King, who regulates all our circumstances, our health &amp; wealth, who bestows his mercies willingly, not by constraint. According to <corr>my</corr> power I open my heart as to a great light to receive the true way, the way of the Lord Jesus the Messiah.</p>


<p>Before I came to the Christian country my religion was the religion of "<hi rend="underline">Mohammed the Apostle of God, may God have mercy upon him, &amp;  give him peace</hi>." I walked to the mosque before daybreak, washed my face &amp; head &amp; hands &amp; feet I prayed at noon, prayed in the afternoon, prayed at sunset, pray-

ed in the evening. I gave alms every year, gold, silver, seeds, cattle, sheep, goats, rice, wheat, &amp;  barley. I gave tithes of all the above-named things. I went every year to the holy war against the infidels. I went on pilgrimage to Mecca, as all did who were able. -- My father had six sons &amp;  five daughters, &amp;  my mother had three sons &amp; one daughter. When I left my country I was thirty seven years old; -- I have been in the country of the Christians twenty four years. -- Written A.D. 1831 <note resp="3?">Written in year one thousand eight hundred and thirty of Jesus the messiah</note></p>

CHAPTER I 
 
 FROM PARIS TO THE NIGER 
 
 THE journey from Paris to the Niger is scarcely so simple as 
 that from Nice to Algeria. 
 
 Having fallen asleep in a railway carriage on your departure 
 from Paris, you awake six weeks later on a canoe-barge upon 
 the Niger. 
 
 The steamer lands you at the entrance to the Senegal, in a 
 country which has belonged to France for centuries, and yet is 
 only known to the general public by its thermometrical mention, 
 inscribed between 'bains ordinaires' 1 and ' culture des vers a 
 sole ' at 40 centigrade as ' the temperature of Senegal.** These 
 rudimentary notions are not even accurate. Will you believe 
 that for months there you wear your greatcoat morning and 
 evening, the mean temperature registered at the local observatory 
 being 24, not 40 ? 
 
 From Dakar (the port of Senegal, and the finest harbour on 
 the west coast of Africa) you go by train to St. Louis, the 
 capital of the colony. Greeting to those one hundred and seventy 
 odd miles of iron road ! They are the first laid by Europeans 
 in Negraic Africa, and date from 1882. Civilisation has stamped 
 other of its signs upon these virgin soils. In St. Louis and at 
 Rufisk (an important commercial town in Dakar Bay) you find 
 the streets lighted by electricity ; and universal suffrage is 
 
2 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 vigorously handled under the form of legislative elections, munici- 
 palities, and general elections. Betting and horse-racing are 
 treated with equal vigour. 
 
 A small service of steamers starts regularly twice a week from 
 the quays of St. Louis for the Sudan. The management on 
 board is comfortable and dear ; and you play poker in the saloon 
 just as on any big self-respecting steamer. For eight days you 
 watch the banks of the Senegal monotonously unfold ; then comes 
 the morning when you moor on a broken bank at the foot of a 
 huge tree. This is Kayes, the port and actual capital of the 
 Sudan. 
 
 A pestilential corner, and the solution of the following difficult 
 problem : How to be at the same time a town in the middle of a 
 swamp and a swamp in the middle of a town. This anomalous 
 method of building a town makes you think for a moment that 
 you have arrived at the end of the world, but you recover your 
 self-possession on seeing the telegraph wires crossing the street 
 and on hearing the whistle of the locomotives. A railway in fact 
 continues the path from the Senegal to the Niger, and will one 
 day carry the traveller right up to Bammaku so easily that we 
 shall be able to reckon it a fortnight from Paris to the Niger. 
 
 At present the railway only extends 108 of the 341 miles that 
 separate Kayes from Bammaku. For the first 78 miles its track 
 (reduced to a three-foot way as are certain local lines in France) is 
 normal and open to commercial traffic. Its administration and 
 maintenance are in the hands of military engineers, and the 
 trains arrive at both ends with remarkable punctuality. Its only 
 mistake is in stopping at Bafoulaba, where the Bafing and the 
 Bakoy unite to form the Senegal. After that you have to con- 
 tent yourself, for the present, with a decauville for the 130 miles 
 to Dioubaba. 
 
4, TIMBUCTOO 
 
 I found my caravan, which had gone on in front, awaiting me 
 at Dioubaba. I picked up luggage, porters, and horse there, 
 and a curious adventure in addition. I had stumbled upon a 
 white horse in the early part of my journey. I say stumbled, 
 for I should assuredly never have bought such a thing; the 
 colonial administration had kindly placed it at my disposal. A 
 white horse ! What a predicament ! Bad luck, as every one 
 knows, bad luck for the rest of the journey! How could I avert 
 
 A RAILWAY STATION 
 
 such an evil omen ? Providence obligingly came to my rescue by 
 one of those secret ways which are His. 
 
 I luckily noticed at Kayes that my saddle-cloth was missing, 
 and I tried all the shops (not a long business) without being able 
 to find another. In these countries the only thing you can find 
 that you want or can rely upon is yourself. I had to fall 
 back upon one of those blankets they sell to the negro, and chose 
 one that was cheap and red, but soft to the horse's back. He, the 
 horse, had come by luggage-van as far as Bafoulaba, but as the 
 decauville was unable to carry him further in that manner, I sent 
 him on by road to Dioubaba, whilst I made use of the little 
 railway. It is just as well to avoid twenty-eight miles of road on 
 
FROM PARIS TO THE NIGER 5 
 
 horseback when you have some hundreds in prospect. It was 
 night when the miniature train entered the leafy vault at Diou- 
 baba, that serves as station and waiting-room. My people were 
 all asleep, and my horse peacefully grazing. Nothing abnormal 
 there, apparently. But at starting next morning, as I was about 
 to bestride my mount for the first time, what did I see ? A 
 scarlet horse ! Imagine my joy ! It was evidently the finger 
 of God that had thus transformed my steed, aided by heat, 
 perspiration, and the negro blanket. Behold me now, full of 
 confidence for the rest of my journey. 
 
 The adventure did not end here, for in spite of repeated 
 groomings and washings it proved impossible to restore my 
 charger to his original colour. The dye, detestable for blankets, 
 is admirable for horses. My animal was the wonder of the natives 
 of all the villages we passed through. ' Ah ! these white men, 
 they said, ' they can even make scarlet horses ! ' 
 
 Enough of the horse ! Let us now review my equipment. 
 First among them is my valet-de-chambre, butler, etc., etc., for 
 numerous functions accumulate in the Sudan under the modest 
 title of ' gar^on? He is a black, thick-lipped fellow, with a 
 European straw hat, a white vest with shiny leather buttons, 
 short breeches with narrow blue and white stripes, naked legs, 
 and feet ditto. One of the survivors of the Bonnier affair, in 
 which he figured under the title of Captain Nigotte's servant/ 
 His master was the solitary officer who escaped from the Touaregs, 
 only to die shortly after my arrival. Splendid testimonials. The 
 doctor says he is ' an excellent sick-nurse.' I immediately engage 
 him upon that, with the idea that if I leave my bones in the 
 desert it will at least be with the conviction that they have been 
 well cared for. To sum him up : he is a well-balanced person, no 
 chatterbox, but dignified, as becomes a person of note. 
 
6 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 There is nothing tragic nor historical about my cook. He is 
 my joy, except in those deadly moments when I rage with despair. 
 I engaged him rather hurriedly. c Can you cook ? ' ' Oh yes ! ' he 
 replied, with the assurance of every good nigger when questioned 
 concerning his capabilities. If I had said, ' Can you paint like 
 Raphael and Murillo ? ' he would have answered ' Oh yes," with 
 equal conviction. In reality he can whistle a few bars of the 
 Marseillaise tolerably well, and can boil water and eggs hard. I 
 do all the rest. 
 
 The third and last person of my establishment is the groom. 
 A silent, bearded fellow, with Semitic profile. He leads the horse 
 up to me when we start, holds the stirrup, and disappears for 
 the rest of the journey, reappearing at the end of it to hold the 
 stirrup, and vanish again with the animal. Never a word says 
 he to me, and never a word say I to him. I do not even know 
 his name : he is a riddle, an enigma. It would not surprise me to 
 learn that he is the nigger from Porte St. Denis, though I have 
 not yet heard the clock ticking in his stomach. 
 
 Around this trinity circle twenty-two natives, uniform as to 
 rarity of drapery, but very varied as to coiffure. Some have 
 hair like astrachan or door-mats ; the heads of others are shaved 
 as bare as a lawyer's chin ; some have a tuft in the middle, others 
 again rejoice in a circular fringe like the beard of some old 
 sea-dog. Scarcely less variegated are the colours of their skins : 
 treacle black, charcoal black, dull prune, shiny prune, coffee 
 colour, Seine colour a whole scale is well represented. 
 
 Place half a hundredweight of baskets and cases upon each 
 head, and you have a very complete sketch of the equipment 
 necessary for travel in the Sudan. 
 
 Having made use of various means of locomotion, since leaving 
 Paris, for accomplishing his journey with comfort and rapidity, 
 
FROM PARIS TO THE NIGER 7 
 
 the traveller now finds himself face to face with the most primitive 
 of all the road, I may add, the African road. That is to say, 
 something vague, that has nothing in common with its European 
 prototype but the name ; something to which levelling, ballasting, 
 a firm soil, and even bridges are unknown. And it is only now 
 that the soul of the African traveller thrills and tastes of joy. 
 Another life is beginning for him, the true life, the only life the 
 life of the bush. 
 
 What makes this life so intoxicating to all who experience it, 
 from the officer straight from the military academy down to the 
 private or marine-artilleryman fresh from a village school ; from 
 the aristocrat of royal descent to the professor of rhetoric ? It 
 captivates all alike ; the ministerial quill-driver become colonial 
 official, the engineer, the artist, and the man of commerce who 
 superintends a factory. 
 
 Its charm cannot easily be explained to the sedentary ; it 
 escapes analysis, being as subtle as it is penetrating. 
 
 Let me see. The food is indifferent, the water is indifferent, 
 the sleeping is indifferent, and your health is often in a precarious 
 state. Heat and fatigue are the only things superior in quality, 
 and yet your heart is filled to overflowing with contentment. As 
 it can hardly be their inconveniences that make the hours spent 
 in the bush so delightful, it must be the sensations that are 
 grafted on them, and the wonderful pictures accompanying them. 
 It is the mingling of the human with the free life of forests and 
 plains that have existed for thousands and thousands of years; 
 and the fact that you are contemplating that life with centuries 
 of civilisation beating in your veins. It is something, too, in the 
 manner in which these people express their thoughts. You are 
 accosted by giants who could crush you between their finger and 
 thumb, and who address you humbly, ' Greet one of God's poor.' 
 
8 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 In another village an old skeleton of a chief totally ignores your 
 arrival, your presence, even your visit. You stand near enough to 
 touch his foot, and he continues impassively squatting and read- 
 ing his Koran, until you half expect to hear the whistling of a 
 lance through the air, to see the flash of a sabre, or hear the 
 cocking of an old musket. Then, again, some old negress stops 
 your horse, mumbling words that are unintelligible. She smiles 
 at you, and offers you a handful of sweet roots. To give her 
 pleasure, and because her wrinkled smile recalls the fact that such 
 poor old things took pity on Rene Caillie and Mungo Park (your 
 predecessors in this corner of Africa), and saved them from dying 
 of hunger, you accept her present of cold cooked roots. Her 
 joy is great, and by some small donation you double it. To 
 put the finishing touch to her pleasing contentment, you bite one 
 of her offerings and continue your way, absently munching the 
 sweet batatas, whose flavour so strangely recalls the marron glace. 
 Memory is sent galloping in pursuit of visions of your native land, 
 and you recall the fact that it is snowing and hailing hard there, 
 while you have been gently cooking since daybreak. 
 
 And then life in the bush means flocks of guinea-fowls run- 
 ning about in the thickets, and coveys of young partridges that 
 rise, careless of sportsmen, from under your horsed very hoofs. 
 It means strange, intoxicating scents that suddenly envelop you, 
 and leave you as suddenly as they came ; and a delirium of sunsets 
 passionately colouring a sky that was monotonously colourless 
 the moment before. And nights ! One night we encamped 
 in the huts surrounding a village square, and my men lighted 
 huge fires in the open air. The gleams from their flames carved 
 a vault of red and gold upon the darkness, and under this arch a 
 fantastic ballet took place. The wings of bats, illuminated from 
 below, made streaks of light upon the night, like the trails of 
 
FROM PARIS TO THE NIGER 9 
 
 falling stars, and were distantly encircled with satellites of fire- 
 flies. 
 
 But I can only give a tenth part, and that feebly, of the 
 unexpected sights and sensations I enjoyed. You cannot taste 
 lifers choicest morsels reclining in an arm-chair. 
 
 Dioubaba, the terminus of the decauville, is situated in the 
 heart of lovely mountain and river scenery. Its landscape would 
 realise a handsome income in Europe. The river Bakoy, hitherto 
 closely confined, here breaks into a rocky waterfall, some hundreds 
 of yards in length, full of rapids and foaming currents. The 
 horizon is bordered by mountain-tops, and the river-banks are 
 covered by gigantic trees festooned with garlands of long creepers. 
 A sergeant of the engineers acts as station-master, and a sapper 
 attends to the telegraph. They are perfectly happy, they say ; 
 and are married, according to the custom of the country, of course, 
 to two gay little natives with charming ways. This society is 
 completed by Bibi, a young hippopotamus, lately captured, and 
 very tame. With a discretion, unlocked for in such an animal, 
 he spends the day in the Bakoy, so as not to interfere with his 
 friends'* occupations. They go to the bank when in want of 
 amusement and call 'Bibi ! Bibi ! ' Bibi's pink muzzle soon appears; 
 he looks round for them with his little black eyes, and, dripping 
 and wriggling, he runs up to be caressed. 
 
 The road from Dioubaba to Bammaku cuts from east to 
 west across the massive Foota Jallon range that separates the 
 basin of the Senegal from that of the Niger. It is full of pictures 
 recalling the Forest of Fontainebleau, and is so abundantly 
 watered that you fall asleep every night to the sound of some 
 gurgling cascade or waterfall. I know nothing more suggestive 
 
10 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 than this road, the main artery of the Sudan. You see the 
 colonial life coming and going upon it from day to day ; and it 
 also reflects the retrospective image of the life that rolled along 
 the great European highways before the days of coaches. With- 
 out the highwaymen, however, for we have made enormous pro- 
 gress since the pacification of the Sudan ten years ago. Then, 
 travellers encamped upon it with sentinels posted at night as if 
 they were in the country of an enemy. To-day it is as safe as the 
 Champs Elysees. 
 
 Not that vehicles are numerous, but people are, and animals. 
 They are principally parties of porters that you meet; some 
 travelling to their destination laden with cases, and bundles, and 
 sacks of millet ; others returning, freed from their burdens, 
 
 ON THE ROAD : DIOULAS HALTING 
 
 dancing and capering along the road to the sound of flute or 
 drum, joyous as children let loose from school. There are dwulas, 
 too, or native commercial travellers, with their servants or slaves 
 
FROM PARIS TO THE NIGER 
 
 11 
 
 and their wives and children, all driving donkeys laden with salt 
 and pearls, etc. 
 
 A meeting between Europeans is particularly pleasant. You 
 
 ON THE ROAD : EUROPEANS TRAVELLING 
 
 exchange bows and a declension of names, and titles when you 
 have them ; and a long talk ensues between two people who have 
 never seen each other in their Jives before. News of the interior 
 is exchanged for news of Europe or the coast. You hear what is 
 passing in the countries to which you are going and in the 
 countries to which you are not going. You exchange a thousand 
 little services, and, above all, the time ! For watches in these 
 climates develop the most fantastic manners, and the only thing 
 you can be sure of is that they will never tell you the time even 
 approximately. After this you turn your backs upon one another 
 with all the grace in the world, and each resumes his journey. 
 
 The Europeans you meet are mostly government officials, 
 
12 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 officers, and privates. Some are returning to France for a holiday, 
 having fulfilled their year or eighteen months of service, while 
 others are newly arrived to take their vacant places. Sometimes 
 
 A COMMISSARIAT TRANSPORT 
 
 you pass a hand-ambulance from which the head of some unlucky 
 invalid emerges, and, if you are good-natured and furnished with 
 plenty of provisions, it is very easy to play the good Samaritan 
 on these occasions. 
 
 Unfortunately the man of commerce only furnishes the smallest 
 share of these encounters : and why ? The answer is to be found 
 in the road itself and the troops of porters you are incessantly 
 meeting upon it, for the head of man is too limited a means of 
 transport to permit a very extensive traffic. Why not use vehicles 
 then? The account given above of the pseudo roads of the 
 Sudan will answer this question, for they exist only in name. 
 The commissariat department knows something of all this, for the 
 forts we have set up in our vast Nigerian possessions must be 
 victualled. Europeans, surrounded by black troops, live in them, 
 
FROM PARIS TO THE NIGER

 keeping the country in order, civilising it, organising it, and 
 preparing it for occupation. It is of course necessary to supply 
 these garrisons with European provisions, such as cases of wine, 
 great iron boxes of flour, coffee, sugar, barrels of salt meat, and arms, 
 ammunition, clothes, tools, etc. To carry these stores to the river 
 (the only easy means of transport) the commissariat possesses carts 
 which are set upon this pretence of a road ; at what cost of time, 
 trouble, and money it would take volumes to tell. One meets 
 these transports from time to time, struggling with the chasms 
 and other asperities of the so-called roads. They are commanded 
 by artillery officers, and are always accompanied by a veterinary ; 
 but I prefer to leave to your imagination the condition to which 
 the unhappy mules are reduced, even though they only do ten or 
 twelve miles a day. It is a terrible thing this victualling, its

 shadow pursues you all along the road. Encampments are pro- 
 vided every ten or twelve miles with straw huts for the men and 
 picket-lines for the animals. You can follow the progress of the 
 
14 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 transports by the litter of rags, bits of paper and abandoned 
 carts they leave behind them. Two forts mark the road from 
 Badoumba to Kita. Neither is. garrisoned, and both have fallen 
 a prey to the commissariat department. Their various outworks 
 and approaches are strewn with a litter of cases on which one 
 reads medicines, sugar, candles, oil, etc., and the names of the 
 places to which these stores are destined Farannah, Siguiri, Segu, 
 or Timbuctoo. The forts themselves are filled from end to end with 
 squatting porters awaiting their share of burdens ; and you hear, 
 in the snatches of conversation and the orders that are flying 
 about, of nothing but c cases ' and ' transport. 1 The impatience 
 with which Europeans and natives alike are awaiting the con- 
 tinuation of the rail from Dioubaba to Bammaku becomes 
 suddenly comprehensible. 
 
 At last beyond Kundu (a third fort, completely abandoned) 
 you reach the line of cleavage between the Senegal and Niger. 
 So far the country has been pleasantly varied, recalling some- 
 what of Switzerland without giving an equal impression of 
 fertility; but in the next and last twenty-five miles of the 
 road springs and rivulets multiply at every step. Agriculture, 
 interspersed with charming glimpses of silvery water, spreads over 
 uninterrupted fields for the rest of the way. The villages cluster 
 closer together, and are more densely populated. In a delight- 
 ful valley of the great Kati mountains a stream tumbles along 
 between two rocky ledges, which start suddenly aside and spread 
 into a fan, to disappear upon the distant banks of the 
 Niger. 
 
 It was not without a certain amount of emotion that I 
 approached the great river, and for this reason. It was four 
 years now since I first started for the Niger and failed to reach 
 
FROM PARIS TO THE NIGER 15 
 
 it ! My then companion, Captain Faidherbe, was making his 
 third attempt to reach that serpent of Western Africa. In his 
 first he followed the Flatters Mission along the Southern 
 Nigerian route. ' In the second, starting from the frontier of 
 Portuguese Guinea, he was stopped by wars among the natives. 
 For the third time he started from Benty and the Mellacoree, 
 in the company of the painter Adrien Marie and myself, only 
 to be cut short by Samory's troops at a distance of twenty- 
 five miles from its banks ; and two years ago he died without 
 having seen the Niger. 
 
 The memory of his ill-fortune possessed me, and grew more 
 intense with every stage of the journey. I had an idea that 
 some of his ill-luck must pursue me. Assuredly I too shall 
 not see this Niger, I thought. And now at last, after doubling 
 the stages for the last five days (so great was my anxiety to 
 reach it), my horse begins to stumble down the steep and rocky 
 declivity that leads to the river. I- dismount, and a fresh anxiety 
 seizes me. Suppose it is only another great disillusion to which 
 I am advancing ? 
 
 The narrow path widens suddenly ; its rocky sides are flung 
 right and left like the leaves of a door. 'There is the Djoliba,' 
 says my historical servant, as calmly as if he were announcing 
 ' Dinner is served.** It is an impressive spectacle from the height 
 of the road that still clings to the hill. A vast horizon lies at 
 my feet bathed in the splendours of a tropical sunset, and 
 down there, in a plain of gold and green and red, shines a silver 
 trail bordered by a line of darkness. There it is, a mere vapour, 
 the dream of a river in a valley of dreams, and the dark line is 
 the hills by which it flows, almost invisibly. 'God is great 1 
 as they say here. There is no disillusion, as is so often the 
 case in the realisation of the unknown. I can scarcely take my 
 
16 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 eyes from the serenely majestic panorama that is spread before 
 me. 
 
 And now come what may ! I remount my horse and urge 
 him to a gallop along the road, bordered by trees, that stretches 
 across the plain. A postern stops me, bearing a placard on which 
 is written in white letters on black, like the name of a railway 
 station : Bammaku.

CHAPTER II 
 
 THE NIGER 
 
 THE Niger, with its vast and misty horizons, is more like an 
 inland ocean than a river. Borne along upon it, scarcely 
 seeing land, the traveller is carried away by those endless 
 dreams which haunt the infinitudes of the sea. Its waters 
 break upon its banks in the monotonously cadenced waves 
 of the Mediterranean shores ; and when winds, grown to 
 violence in the desert, swell its waves into a great race, sea- 
 sickness will convince the most rebellious that the river Niger 
 is of kin to oceans. 
 
 Its shores, no less than its waves, resemble those of the 
 ocean. Only occasionally rising into cliffs, as at Koulikoro, they 
 more frequently call to mind our own Atlantic strands, being 
 formed, not of the white impalpable dust of the desert, but of 
 the true reddened shingle of the beach. 
 
 Like the oceans, the Niger possesses its sailors, not merely 
 occasional seamen, but whole populations, privileged to serve it 
 exclusively, living for it and by it alone. They are the Somnos 
 or Bosos, and are not the aboriginals of the Nigerian countries, 
 but were among the first of those great migrations of people 
 who saw Western Africa across the centuries. The history of 
 
 18 
 
THE NIGER 
 
 19 
 
 their origin is shrouded in a legend which the ancient among 
 them are very willing to impart. 
 
 'Our ancestors, 1 they say, 'came from the great mountains 
 of the East. 1 Do they mean the mountains of Ethiopia? 
 Could they have come from the hills surrounding the Upper 
 Nile ? They have no idea. Nothing in their features recalls 
 
 the marked type of the 
 Eastern African, and 
 their skins are as black 
 to-day as those of 
 the natives of the 
 
 A FISHING-VILLAGE ON THE BANKS OF THE NIGER 
 
 Sudan. The one thing their legend preserves for certain is, that 
 even in those early times they were a purely aquatic people. 
 They fished and navigated for the king of their country, being 
 bond-servants, apparently, to the crown. The Sudanese to this 
 day do not reckon them among the free tribes. 
 
 Thus they boated and fished upon their rivers, until one day 
 the king wished them to build him houses and bridges. This 
 was a task alien to their caste, the work of slaves according to 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 their ideas, and 
 therefore repug- 
 nant to them. 
 In revenge they 
 offered their king 
 a present of 
 poisoned tor- 
 toise, of which 
 he ate and died ; 
 whereupon they 
 took flight in 
 
 their vessels, carrying all the boats with them, to ensure against 
 pursuit. They followed the course of river after river in their 
 flight until they arrived at the Niger, which, according to them, 
 flowed to the north. 
 
 And there they live to this day, lining its streams and 
 tributaries with villages that recall the fishing-hamlets of our 
 own coasts. They form the sole population of these settlements 
 and occupy distinct quarters in the towns and cities, thus em- 
 phasising the fact that the Bosos still belong exclusively to the 
 river. All this gave me a reflex affection for them which 
 increased with knowledge, gained by many days spent in the 
 midst of their lives. I have seen them set out to the capture 
 of their great prey (the alligator and sea-cow), looking, the black 
 Bosos in his black canoe, like a bronze group against the blinding 
 light. In the bow of the long, narrow, unsteady pirogue one 
 of their number stands upright in a fine attitude of attack, 
 whilst the other, crouching in the stern, noiselessly obeys the 
 directions of his companion. Silently, almost without movement, 
 they advance until the watchful eye in the bow discerns some 
 alligator asleep on the tide, or some great bearded fish dozing 
 
THE NIGER 21 
 
 betwixt wind and water. Then the nude silhouette in the bow 
 is strained by a beautiful movement of the free body, the right 
 arm is poised, and the harpoon flung, striking the great beast 
 unawares. 
 
 The Bosos is not only the fisherman, he is also the boatman 
 of the Niger, and I have seen him exert admirable physical 
 qualities in this latter capacity, yielding nothing in sobriety and 
 endurance to the ocean-going sailor. The six or eight men 
 forming the crew of my boat worked day and night, alternately 
 sitting to wield the paddle when the water was deep, and stand- 
 ing, when the bottom could be felt, to ply the long bamboo 
 poles. This variation was the only relaxation they allowed 
 themselves besides a few moments for their meals. And what 
 meals they were ! If I had permitted it, a few handfuls of 
 millet seed, neither cooked nor ground, but merely moistened 
 with water, would have amply satisfied them. Sometimes when 
 the moon was late in rising, or slumber proved too inviting, 
 one of their number would chant some monotonous and melan- 
 choly refrain to which the singer improvised brief couplets which 
 were taken up in chorus by his comrades. Now and again they 
 would rouse themselves to greater exertions by their cry of 
 6 Tara (quickly), tara, Bosos ! ' The six or seven days of our 
 journeying were only broken by some four or five hours of 
 indifferent repose, uncomfortably snatched at the bottom of the 
 boat, and disturbed by the continued paddling of their com- 
 panions. Could any men of our race furnish a like example of 
 endurance ? The chatter and laughter were a little less perhaps 
 in the last few days, and they had recourse rather more fre- 
 quently to powdered tobacco (their only stimulant), which some 
 thrust up their nostrils and others into their mouths. These 
 were the only signs of unusual fatigue which they permitted to 
 
22 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 appear. Nor were their exertions undertaken from any motives 
 of devotion, but for a man whom they had never seen until a 
 few moments before starting, and whom they knew they would 
 leave soon after reaching their destination. Moreover, my very 
 eagerness to press forward was unintelligible to them. Time 
 has neither value nor meaning for them ; they do not even know 
 their own ages, and their life is merely a road, sometimes long, 
 sometimes short, but in any case leading nowhere. 
 
 For the first few days I had to discipline and threaten a 
 little, and, when warnings failed, to distribute a few blows. A 
 strict impartiality always determined these awards, and since a 
 rigid sense of justice is preserved in all primitive natures, they 
 bore me no ill-will for the chastisement. With the mark of 
 the blow still showing grey on their black shoulders, they would 
 seize the first and least pretext to shout with laughter, while 
 the boat slipped along .with increased rapidity to the cry of 
 ' Tara, tara, Bosos ! ' 
 
 One more tribute I will pay them. Alone among them, 
 distant many days 1 journey from the white man, and travelling 
 through an imperfectly conquered, sometimes openly hostile 
 country, never once did I feel that my safety was in any way 
 threatened. Was it entirely owing to the superiority of the 
 white man, a conviction of which becomes firmly impressed upon 
 one (in spite of natural modesty and philosophy) as one traces 
 one's path through these virgin countries ? Did not this sense 
 of security proceed as much from a contemplation of the attrac- 
 tive manners daily displayed before my eyes, the litany of greet- 
 ings exchanged with the unknown occupants of the canoes we 
 met or overtook, and the good-nature and disinterestedness 
 evinced by all ? Fishing Bosos would spontaneously offer my 
 
THE NIGER 23 
 
 men a share of their catch, a fine fish, or a portion of alligator. 
 Hardly slackening the pace to receive the gift, thanks would 
 still be flying when we had left the giver far behind. ' Tara, 
 tara, Bosos ! ' 
 
 Is it surprising that the hours spent upon the vast dominions 
 of the Niger should seem pleasant to me ? Is it not probable that 
 they will represent the happiest hours of my life as I watch my 
 staff' of travel burning on my hearth ? They will remain as the 
 souvenirs of a cruise into infinite space and liberty, as a brief 
 escape from the thousand fetters mankind has placed upon man 
 under the pretence of progress. Their memory is a vision of 
 a primeval existence ignorant of good and evil, living, without 
 effort and without laws, an upright and good life. It was, in 
 short, a flight from all the falseness and corruption that civilisa- 
 tion has put into the heart of man, the realisation of the dream 
 which, though played with by many philosophies, has been accom- 
 plished by none. 
 
 Ah, that delightful, that matchless cruise, which you, for- 
 tunate possessors of fast, sumptuous, and elegant yachts, can never 
 enjoy ! 
 
 My yacht would have ill-supported any one of those adjectives, 
 for it was a whimsical mixture of European barge and aboriginal 
 canoe. It had borrowed from the former its breadth of beam 
 and its flat bottom, and from the latter its sharply pointed 
 extremities and its deplorable facility for springing a leak. A 
 thatched hollow served me amidships as bedroom, dining-room, 
 study, and dressing-room. I enjoyed, moreover, an amphibious 
 existence, for the water unceasingly trickled through the flooring 
 into my apartment. A small folding bedstead was my only piece 
 of furniture. Table, cupboards, desk, washstand, and sideboard 
 were represented by different packages, wicker baskets, bottle- 
 
24 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 cases, and portmanteaux. A long box filled with earth served as 
 kitchen and stove, and was placed fore and aft in accordance 
 with the direction of the wind. In the remaining very limited 
 spaces the seven or eight men who handled the boat were dis- 
 tributed, together with two bleating sheep (representing our 
 meat-supply) and some clucking hens. The game brought 
 down by lucky shots, and the fish and other properties of 
 my men, were extra ; and, in addition to all this, some place 
 had to be found for the kitchen fuel. For the benefit of 
 those who like figures and complicated problems, I will add that 
 my Noah's ark measured twenty-six feet three by seven feet six in 
 the widest part. 
 
 Obviously it would have embarrassed me to give one of those 
 Trouville or Cannes fetes to which my fellow-yachtsmen are 
 accustomed, but luckily the occasion never arose. Yet fetes there 
 were, provided day and night by the Niger with a variety and

 splendour that the richest merchant in sugar-plums could not 
 have equalled. Its waters were now blue as the Mediterranean, 
 now grey as the North Sea, and now again they were apparelled 
 in the green of the great ocean ; while Venus Anadiomenes in 
 
 black sported upon

 latter were not smil- 
 ingly coiling their 
 tresses, it was only 
 because their hair 
 was short and 
 greased with butter.

 occupation, they

 utensils and washing their children in the splashing wave. Art, 
 however, lost nothing by that, for, in their constantly changing 
 attitudes, their perfect nudity only served to call attention to 
 their marvellously sculptured torsos and their bronze skins, 
 touched into gold by the brightness of the sunshine. 
 
26 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 Here and there upon the great strands were playing the strange 
 childish forms, with the great heads and stomachs'balanced on the 
 slender limbs, of the negro babies. Drolly would they interrupt 
 their games and run close to the river-bank to^watch the white

 man pass, making him the while a military salute ! Nothing 
 more comical could be imagined than these little naked caricatures 
 with one arm stiffly raised at an angle. If I smiled, they gave me 
 back the same broad laugh the Venus Anadiomenes had tossed 
 me with their ' Anissagai ' (Good day) the same that my Bosos 
 laughed a minute after they had been struck. This gentle 
 laughter, with neither intellect nor malice in it, is always ready 
 to their lips, even in the most serious circumstances, and is as 
 necessary to their existence apparently as food or water. It is the 
 happy mirth of a childish people, ignorant of the physical and 
 moral torments from which the more perfect man results. 
 
 The placid fisher with the line also greets us in military 
 fashion. This form of salutation seems to be the only thing 
 that our civilisation has brought them so far. Poor souls ! when 
 the rest has followed they will have ceased to laugh. 
 
 Between Segu and the regions bordering Timbuctoo I passed

 wonderful herds of oxen, horses, goats, and sheep. Unlike the 
 stunted cattle and emaciated hacks of the countries of the Niger's 
 source, these oxen had imposing humps, and the horses were on 
 the lines of Arabs. The sheep, too, were astonishing. Long 
 fleece replaced the close wool of the southern animal, and their 
 flocks were to be counted by sucli thousands of heads that I was 
 greeted at long distances by ovations of bleating. 
 
 Travelling one day between Lake Debo and Sarafara, it was 
 given me to see quite another sort of herd. We were touching 
 upon a large plain bordered by a distant wood, when suddenly, 
 at sunset, four black lions appeared walking in Indian file. 
 They advanced with slow and solemn steps, pausing with heads 
 erect as the sound of our paddles reached them. After fixing 
 upon us a look that was half-displeased, half-disdainful, they 
 turned their backs upon us, and, still keeping the same order, 
 disappeared with unmoved slowness and solemnity in the wooded

 PASTURE ON THE SHORES OF THE NIGER 
 
 green of the distance. The scene was so captivating that the 
 thought of my Winchester never entered my head. The gun 
 was always at hand, however, to spread a little perturbation 
 (impossible to effect more appreciable results) among the families 
 
28 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 of hippopotami who, towards evening, thrust their pink muzzles out 
 of the water, and to annoy the numerous alligators who relaxed 
 in sunny slumbers throughout the day. 
 
 The feathered species did not get off so cheaply, however, 
 especially the wild ducks, whom, at my leisure, I would invite 
 to my table in the shape of roast or stew. The white ospreys, 
 the Niger's favourite bird, were truly innumerable. They dappled 
 the banks, looking like flakes of precious snow, with silky reflec- 
 tions made lustrous by the sun. The gracious outlines of their 
 slender forms, the supple necks and long slim legs, stood out 
 in such dainty visions from the green grass and grey banks that 
 one shot them remorsefully. Alas ! their death-warrant is written 
 and attached to the base of their slender necks ; for it is there, 
 and not on their heads, that the fragile plumes grow delicate 
 emblems of themselves and of those alone who should be privileged 
 to wear them. From these plumes, in fact, are made those precious 
 parures which, mounted in jewelled clasps, place such a charming 
 point of pride upon the forehead of brunette and blonde alike. 
 The allurement of such a spoil, seen in imagination adorning 
 some cherished head, dispels all remorse, and hastens the fall of the 
 trigger. 
 
 The confidence of these charming birds is very great, for the 
 native, disdainful of its flesh and ignorant of the value of its 
 plumes, has never hunted it. They alight boldly in the midst of 
 the flocks of sheep that have such an inexplicable attraction for 
 them, and it is very quaint to see groups of two or three ospreys 
 surround each sheep, and with gravely measured steps follow its 
 browsing until the innocent ruminant looks like some captive sur- 
 rounded by its gaolers. 
 
 Other birds of valuable feather dart about the sands, such as 
 the marabou, metallic blackbirds, kingfishers in every shade of 
 
THE NIGER 29 
 
 wonderful azure, and flocks of guinea-fowls, flamingoes, and pelicans. 
 Sometimes, on approaching the sedgy banks, a strange rustling is 
 followed by a cloud of dust. It is caused by those tiny creatures, 
 scarcely bigger than crickets, the millet-eaters. I must not forget 
 to mention the trumpet-bird among my intimate friends a large 
 black wader, whose note might easily be mistaken for the horn of 
 our tramways. 
 
 As infinitely varied as the colours of the kingfisher are the 
 scenes in which this medley of life unfolds. At Toulimandio 
 
 THE SHORES OF LAKE DEBO AT GOURAO : GUNBOAT STATION 
 
 the shores are formed of high woods of wonderful verdure, 
 dark and deep as velvet, and the mountains seen in the distance 
 are the last ramifications of the Foota Jallon range. Were 
 it not for the unaccustomed proportions of the river and the 
 marvellous sun, there would be nothing specially tropical about 
 this country. 
 
 Little by little the woods thin and the trees diminish in 
 height. The river-bed is strewn with trunks torn from the banks 
 by the floods, and many more hang disconsolately over the water, 
 certain victims to the approaching inundations. 
 
30 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 At Nyamina, Segu, and Sansanding, the woods give place to 
 great plains of tillage and cattle-rearing, that spread further than 
 the eye can reach, and close upon them follows, with Lake Debo, 
 a maritime scene. This lake is a huge basin of water by the 
 side of the river, and, the two hillocks guarding its entrance 
 being passed, a veritable sea spreads before you. Water every- 
 where, always, and for ever. Its shores are invisible, for no distant 
 mountains betray their boundaries, as is the case with the Swiss 
 lakes. 
 
 An equally unexpected vision awaits the traveller beyond 
 Lake Debo ; and it is now a landscape from Normandy or 
 England that is disclosed to eyes stupefied by such an apparition 
 in the heart of tropical Africa. Great meadows of a moist, 
 intense green are bordered by park-like woods. So vivid is the 
 impression that you are disappointed not to see the turrets and 
 battlements of a Lancashire manor, or the slated roofs of 
 some Chateau of the Eure, rising from their midst. The superb

 troops of humped cattle, large and sleek, scarcely dispel this 
 northern illusion. 
 
 All this changes after Sarafara, and it is now the tangle of a 
 tropical forest that defiles before my yacht, now some Eastern 
 scene that I have already witnessed in Egypt or Syria. Palm- 
 
 
 MOUNT ST. HENRI 
 
 trees, slenderly erect, dominate a scanty vegetation containing 
 the melancholy green of the olive - trees of Palestine, and 
 thickets of low bushes that recall the fig-trees of Judaea. 
 
 El Oual Hadj passed, bright green stretches of quite 
 another character appear, and the villages no longer crowd 
 together upon the bank, but are scattered out of sight, far 
 removed from the river-banks on account of the floods. The 
 only perceptible signs of life come from the fires of these villages, 
 that streak the sky with ribbons of smoke by day and tinge it 
 with red at night. You may travel miles and miles without 
 seeing a living thing, man or beast, upon the shores. An 
 atmosphere of secrecy hovers over the country : you suddenly 
 recall the fact that those mysterious Touaregs are still momen- 
 tarily its masters and oppressors, and you slip sixteen balls into 
 your Winchester. 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 Finally, on the borders of Timbuctoo the dunes of the 
 Sahara begin to oppose the sterility of their bare whiteness to the 
 river, increasing in number until the desert itself is behind them. 
 
 Varied as these scenes are, they possess a still further element 
 
 of change in the formidable 
 rising and falling of the river. 
 A scene known at the height 
 of the waters is unrecognis- 
 able in the fall. Taking the

 interval, you seem to be following an entirely different river. 
 Where before you sailed in the midst of plains, you now pass 
 between banks some twenty-six feet high. There, where a vast 
 stretch of water gave the impression of a sea, you find a combina- 
 tion of pools and sandbanks recalling the flat shores of the ocean 
 at low tide. At Timbuctoo it flows in swift and foaming 
 
UNIVERSITY V

 torrents, its sides and bed being encumbered with rocks. The 
 towns and villages, at which you had gone ashore to the nearest 
 houses, are now perched upon mounds encircled by vigorously 
 growing grass, and wearing the little airs of a Rhenish burg. 
 Fields of tobacco-plants and kitchen gardens flourish on the 
 uncovered banks, while before Segu the oyster-beds pierce the 
 surface of the water. This is in the fall. 
 
 All the effects of the rise originate from below Lake Debo, 
 at Mopti, where the river is joined by another as important as 
 itself, namely, the Bani. Towards December they have become 
 a vast mass of waters rushing to the north, and entire plains are 
 submerged to a considerable depth. On the right of Lake Debo 
 an immense region to which the little arm of Koli-Koli formerly 
 gave access, has now become a fief of the Niger. The greatest 
 surprise of all awaits the traveller here, for it is literally a sea 
 of grass. How does that strike you, my luxurious fellow- 
 yachtsmen ? It is in truth a singular element, being neither

 land nor water, but a strange mixture of both ; without being 
 a marsh, however, for, the waters not being stagnant, the passing 
 breeze raises no fetid odour. From a depth of six to eight feet 
 the tall grasses emerge, thick and green, and wearing all the 
 appearance of a great field. One of our sheep was so deceived 
 by it that he threw himself overboard, thinking to arrive on 
 pasturage, but committed suicide instead. 
 
 Between banks perfectly clear cut, though formed solely by 
 grass, winds that Koli-Koli which has brought hither and 
 spread afar all these waters. The boundaries of Lake Korienza 
 are no less sharply defined in this bizarre element. 
 
 In crossing this region my Bosos recommended the abandon- 
 ment of the easy, but infinitely capricious and winding, course of 
 the Koli-Koli. The journey, they say, will be greatly lessened 
 by cutting straight across this sea of green, a change of route 
 that suits me to perfection. 
 
 Paddling being no longer possible, the men, leaning heavily 
 on their bamboos, push the boat vigorously through the grass, 
 which, parting in front, closes together behind us with loud 
 rustling and crackling. We are no longer upon the water, but 
 seem, and it is a truly exotic sensation, to be sliding under a 
 tropical sun over grassy steppes streaked with watery paths. 
 This region of navigable grass is a world apart ; the repeated 
 passage of canoes has worn away the green and traced ribbons of 
 water on its surface, in the same manner that the constant tread 
 of man and beast upon the earth destroys the grass and exposes 
 the bare soil. These paths, as conventionality would require of 
 them, are beautifully flowered. Placid water-lilies adorn their 
 surfaces with cups of white, mauve, and yellow, and they are 
 further encompassed by a strange tropical bindweed looking 
 like chaplets of floating onions. With this trivial, perhaps, but 
 
THE NIGER 
 
 35 
 
 certainly apt, comparison they possess another point of resemblance, 
 they are edible, and are greatly esteemed by the native in times' 
 of dearth. 
 
 It would be ungrateful if among all these pictures, pale images 
 as they are of hours of enchantment, I forgot to include the 
 twilights and nights upon the Niger. 
 
 The moments of $ sunset upon the river are those

 with gay chatter and laughter, the bleating of sheep, and 
 the clucking of frightened poultry. In the solitudes beyond 
 human habitation the timid hippopotamus, again become the 
 autocrat of the river, gambols grotesquely in the water, prudently 
 waiting until nightfall to come ashore and dine; and the 
 great trees on the bank are so whitened at this hour by the 
 
36 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 sleeping ospreys that they seem to have been covered by a fall of 
 
 snow. 
 
 I now join a village and spread my table-cloth on some grassy 
 hillock close to the river-bank. Very animated and well attended 
 are my dinners. First the children come, consumed with curiosity 
 to see the white man, but a little apprehensive too. They advance 
 timidly, evidently feeling for me some of the fear which the negro 
 inspires in white children. A few lumps of sugar soon tame them, 
 however, and then, duly apprised, the chief and notabilities of the 
 village arrive. They salute me and offer (read ' sell ') presents of 
 milk, eggs, and poultry, and, business being done, I detain them 
 with a little of those two precious commodities, tobacco and salt. 
 
 We light great fires as night falls, and they bring out their 
 little clay pipes, their snuff-boxes, or some kola-nuts, and a long 
 gossip ensues. Absorbing landscape all day, night reveals to 
 me the soul and thoughts of the country, its history, and the why 
 of a thousand things the sight of which had puzzled me during 
 the day. Above everything, I enjoyed evoking oral traditions 
 concerning the first appearance of the white man in these parts. 
 Mungo Park, the first European to explore the Niger, is the most 
 vividly remembered. I frequently heard, between Nyamina and 
 Khabara, of Bonci-Ba (the great beard), a name given him by 
 the Nigerian tribes, but I could find no trace of our own Rene 
 Caillie even at Timbuctoo itself. Earth's voyage, though not 
 accomplished in these regions, is well known by report of people 
 who saw him or heard him spoken of in Timbuctoo. The old 
 men, with wrinkled skins and white hair and eyebrows, were my 
 favourite historians. They could recall to me the past prosperity 
 and great commerce of the Valley of the Niger. They told me of 
 the desolating conquerors and disastrous wars of the present cen- 
 
THE NIGER 37 
 
 tury ; of Cheikou Alimadou, the fanatic Foulbe king, who changed 
 the prosperity of former days to misery. Timbuctoo \vas the 
 most frequent subject of my questions. It was the home of 
 
 I 
 
 their youthful memories, and they would speak of it enthusi- 
 astically, and with laughter much laughter at the recol- 
 lections of their gay life there, the t t lively frolics which 
 
 
 GOING ASHORE IN THE EVENING 
 
 sweetened their labours, and the especially vivid remembrance of 
 the bewitching beauty of the ladies of Timbuctoo. 
 
 In the villages of the Bosos the Niger formed the basis of our 
 conversation. They would narrate to me the legends and the life 
 
38 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 and being of the giant. On the margin of Lake Debo, they told 
 me, a treasure of gold was hidden in the hillock, which Rene Caillie 
 pompously christened ' Mont St. Charles, 1 and which they call 
 Mount Sorba. The treasure remains undiscovered to this day. 
 They often alluded to a very large town situated on a lake called 
 Guido. It was the centre of a powerful empire, which, with its 
 capital, has now entirely disappeared. 
 
 Finally, with so many other affinities to the great oceans, the 
 Niger could not decently lack its romances of pirates. They had 
 their nest at Sibi, a large village crowning a high mound on the 
 Black Niger. It was passed daily by numberless boats laden with 
 the produce of Massina and Farinanka. Kaid-Ali, the chief of 
 the pirates, was taken with the ingenious idea of stretching an iron 
 chain across the river, in order to prevent the escape of these 
 boats, which he pillaged at leisure. 
 
 These Bosos, living at a distance of eight hundred and seventy 
 miles from the coast, possess, as one might imagine, no idea of the 
 sea or of the part of outlet that it plays to the rivers. The 
 question of what becomes of the Niger beyond the regions they 
 know troubles them very little. I sometimes attempted, in the 
 course of conversation, to enlighten their minds on this point. 
 Having one day captured an unusually intelligent Bosos, I made 
 him enumerate all the towns he knew, or had heard of, down the 
 Niger. ' Sarafara, Khabara, Gao," he came to a standstill. ' Well ! 
 and beyond them, what becomes of the river?' 'Beyond them, 1 
 he reflected. ' Oh ! beyond them the fishes swallow it. 1 
 
 When I found some village particularly rich in information and 
 the power of imparting it, I would stay over the following day in 
 order to renew the nocturnal chat, generally retiring to the river 
 at night on account of its beneficial freshness. In the distance, 
 beacon-like fires blazing on the brim of the great river would 
 
THE NIGER 39 
 
 indicate some native ball, and on approaching one could hear the 
 droning of tom-toms and the cadenced clapping of hands that 
 always accompany these functions. Elsewhere, grazing in the 
 now deserted fields, the noctambulating hippopotamus would 
 neigh us his serenades. 
 
 Great fires cover the banks in March. It is the black man^s 
 method of clearing and manuring his fields on the eve of seed- 
 time. He destroys the tall grasses and other parasites by these 
 means, and enriches his soil with their ashes. Thus magnificently 
 illuminated, we glide over the water to the sound of a great 
 crackling which is occasionally mingled with the cry of some wild 
 animal that the flames have surprised in its lair. 
 
 In this manner I wandered so much at my own sweet will that 
 even my Bosos, expert as they are, were obliged to confess them- 
 selves bewildered at times. With all these pleasures spiced with 
 the apprehension of a sudden illness or unexpected attack, and 
 sustained by the thought of having some lines of the world's 
 history at the end of my pen when Jenne and Timbuctoo should 
 be attained, am I not right in saying that the cruise of my 
 thatched yacht was a unique one ? 
 
CHAPTER III 
 
 THE VALLEY OF THE NIGER 
 
 THE ancient renown of Timbuctoo, its boasted commerce, and 
 its prestige as a rich and powerful metropolis, warrant the 
 assertion a priori that the regions surrounding this city of the 
 Niger must be remarkably fertile. It could hardly have usurped 
 such a reputation. History affords no parallel of an error con- 
 tinuing to deceive the world through four or five centuries. 
 
 The geographer, sitting in his study between a modern map 
 of Africa and the works of El Bekri, Ca da Mosto, De Baros, 
 Leon the African, and other travellers, would reason thus : With 
 sand to the north-east and west of it the huge market of 
 Timbuctoo is situated on the threshold of the desert. Yet it 
 is not with sand that the wheels of such an enormous traffic are 
 greased. In order, therefore, that Timbuctoo should be enabled 
 to play the part attributed to it, we should expect to find a rich 
 extent of territory in the south, an isthmus of fertility, as it 
 were, jutting into the sea of sand. We should anticipate this 
 stretch of land to be large, since it has maintained a great 
 commerce for some centuries, and supplied such varied markets 
 as Morocco, Tuat, and Tripoli, as well as the various nomad 
 populations of the desert. 
 
 Do these fertile regions really possess the happy distinction 
 
 40 
 
THE VALLEY OF THE NIGER 41 
 
 of being discoverable by mere force of logic, as certain stars 
 are by mathematical calculation ? 
 
 The occupation of Timbuctoo has made it possible to 
 verify such surmises by opening up routes, accessible not only 
 to the explorer proper, who crosses the country worn by priva- 
 tion and at the mercy of his guides, but available also for the 
 traveller who lingers to gather complete information at his ease. 
 
 This country lying to the south of Timbuctoo is the Sudan, 
 otherwise called the Valley and the Buckler of the Niger, a vast 
 region, traversed to an extent of nearly 2500 miles by one of 
 the largest rivers in the world. 
 
 Egypt was happily defined by Herodotus as being the 
 ' present of the Nile." What Herodotus said of Egypt we might 
 with equal truth say of the Sudan. 
 
 The Arabian conqueror Amru, who took possession of Egypt 
 in the seventh century, gives the following complete and accurate 
 description of it in a letter to his master the Khalif Omar. 
 
 ' O Prince of the Faithful ! Picture unto thyself .an arid 
 desert and a fruitful country, for such is Egypt. A beneficent 
 river flows majestically through its midst. The rise and fall of 
 its waters are as regular as the course of the sun and the moon. 
 At an appointed time all the springs of the universe come to pay 
 tribute to this king of rivers. They cause its waters to swell 
 and leave their bed, covering the surface of Egypt with a fruitful 
 mire, and when the waters cease to be necessary for the fertilisation 
 of the soil, the obedient river returns to the limits prescribed to 
 it by destiny, in order that the treasures it has hidden in the 
 bosom of the earth may be gathered. The people thus favoured 
 by Heaven sow seeds in the bowels of the earth, that they may 
 be brought to prosperity by the munificence of the Supreme 
 Being who causes harvests to ripen. The most abundant 
 
42 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 harvests are succeeded by sudden sterility; and thus it is, O Prince 
 of the Faithful, that Egypt offers successively the images of an 
 arid and sandy desert, a liquid and silvery plain, a marsh of 
 black mire, a green, undulating meadow, and a field of golden 
 grain. Blessed for ever be the Creator of such marvels." 
 
 What the Nile has done for Egypt, the Niger has accom- 
 plished for the Sudan. In the course of a year we witness 
 the same striking and opposed pictures. The cultivation is as 
 facile as that of Egypt, and is due to the same regular rise and 
 fall of the river. But the Niger shows an even greater munifi- 
 cence in its gifts than does its brother of Eastern Africa. For 
 thousands of years the labour of man has co-operated with the 
 beneficent work of the latter, and yet, flowing imbedded between 
 two mountain chains, it only carries fertility to some few 
 hundreds or thousands of feet; while the Niger, on the other 
 hand, owing to its immense plains, dispenses its benefits over 
 an extent of more than sixty miles without the intervening aid 
 of man. 
 
 The prestige of Timbuctoo in the past, and its boasted 
 commerce, are now explained by finding it as we do upon the 
 threshold of another Egypt, equally favoured by nature, but 
 infinitely greater in extent. Its only disadvantages consist in not 
 having been developed by four or five thousand years of civilisa- 
 tion, and in not standing in the doorway of Europe as does the 
 Valley of the Nile. 
 
 The Niger rises in the mountain chain which extends from the 
 country of Sulima in the north to Kono in the south, and spreads 
 to the Kissi country in the east. Contrary to the generally 
 accepted opinion, the range is not, geologically speaking, a 
 dependency of that Foota Jallon upheaval which is considered the 
 
44 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 centre of a great movement whose subordinate branches were 
 pushed beyond the sources of the Niger. In reality, the range of 
 the Niger's sources, or the Kouranko chain, forms the true centre 
 of the upheaval. Its altitudes, in the countries of Negaya and 
 Kono, attain to 3840 feet (sources of the Niger), and 4920 feet in 
 
 the south, while 
 the average eleva- 
 tion of the Foota 
 Jallon is not more 
 than 2625 feet. 
 
 The principal 
 summits of the 
 Kouranko range 
 are : Mount 
 Bondi, Mount 
 Ma,MountKeina, 
 Mount Konko- 
 Kourawa, the two 
 Kolas, the two 
 Soullous, Mount 
 Kokonante 
 (sources of the 
 Niger), Mount 
 Darou , the needles 
 of Kinki, the Songoula, the Banka, Fingui, Soofoa, Tinki, 
 Owaloo, Kora, and the Toumba (the four last are in the country 
 of Kono). 
 
 In the Kissi country two rivers, the Paliko and the Tembi, 
 flow towards the north, pursue a parallel course, and, meeting at 
 Laya, unite in one bed to become the Niger or Joliba. The most 
 important of the two rivers is the Tembi, considered by the 
 
 THE SOURCES OF THE NIGER TEMBI 
 
THE VALLEY OF THE NIGER 45 
 
 natives as the Father of Joliba. It rises in a little hill to the 
 east of Mount Kokonante, and not far from the foot of Mount 
 Darou. The hill from which the Tembi flows is in no way 
 remarkable from a topographical point of view. Bare at its 
 summit, it is covered a little lower down with a vegetation which, 
 growing thicker as it descends towards the waterway of the 
 valley, proclaims the presence of water. 
 
 About a hundred feet from the summit of the hill is a little 
 basin, about three feet in diameter and a foot in depth, full of 
 clear water, and called by the natives Tembi Kuntu, or Head of 
 Tembi. A hundred feet further down is another and larger basin, 
 which is not easily found on account of the thick vegetation, the 
 inextricable confusion of thorny canes, trees thrown down by 
 storms, tangles of creepers and tree ferns, in which it is hidden. 
 
 The water of this little creek flows through the wood, and 
 re-appears 656 feet lower down in the valley. At this point the 
 Ternbi is a mere rivulet ; 875 yards from its source it has become, 
 at the village of Tembi Kuntu, a gentle stream, increasing rapidly 
 in size and depth as it flows towards the north. At Nelia, eight 
 miles from the source, it is eighty feet wide, and at Faranna, 
 sixty-two miles from the source, it has attained a breadth of 
 nearly 328 feet. 
 
 The wood from which the Tembi springs is reputed sacred, 
 and is the subject of innumerable legends and superstitions. 
 Access to it is denied to the profane; terrible misfortunes over- 
 take any one uttering a word or touching anything there, and 
 warriors and all who have shed blood die on approaching this 
 spot. Its waters are believed to express the judgments of God. 
 If a man is accused of some crime which he denies he is forced 
 to drink of them, and if he is guilty his sin is proved by an 
 inflation of the stomach, followed by instant death. 
 
46 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 The natives say that in the centre of the little creek of Tembi 
 is a rocky islet. This little island is the abode of the Spirit of 
 the Spring, and the mysterious retreat of the High Priest who 
 represents the deity to mortals. He takes up his residence there 
 by plunging into the water and approaching it invisibly. Accord- 
 ing to the legend there is a golden dwelling at the bottom of the 
 lake, and his acolytes, the minor prophets, profess to have heard 
 
 THE TEMBI IN THE SACRED WOOD 
 
 the noise he makes in opening and shutting the doors of his super- 
 natural home. High priests and lesser priests unite in jealously 
 guarding the approaches to the spring, and the mystery they 
 make of it confers great distinction and authority upon them 
 throughout the country. The neighbouring kinglets refer to 
 them before undertaking a war or other act of importance, and 
 the common herd consult them on all occasions of weight. 
 The Spirit of the Spring, being eminently practical, will 
 
TIMBUCTOO 47 
 
 only condescend to attend to them through the medium of 
 sacrifice. 
 
 These ceremonies are not very ferocious, merely oxen being 
 offered, and not human victims, as in neighbouring Dahomey. 
 The oxen, however, must be young, as the Spirit likes his meat 
 to be tender. The immolations do not take place at the spring, 
 but in the village of Nalia, where the priests live with their 
 wives and families. When the animal is slaughtered the best 
 portions are cut off, and naturally go to the ministers of the 
 Spirit and their families. The head and legs are left adhering 
 to the skin, which is then stuffed, sewn up, and thrown into the 
 river as it flows past the sacrificial spot. A few paces further 
 on the stream momentarily disappears through a subterranean 
 passage. The stuffed ox disappears with the Tembi, to reappear 
 later on, its head proudly erect, as, apparently overflowing with 
 life, it rears and plunges, appearing and disappearing with the 
 bubbling of the current. Every one then retires satisfied ; the 
 Spirit of the Spring and his ministers pleased with the prospect 
 of some first-rate meals, and the people, who had defrayed the 
 costs, charmed by the gambols of their ox. 
 
 This Kissi region lies in the ninth latitude, where the last 
 ramifications of the Foota Jallon mountains join the first 
 buttresses of the Kong chain. The source of the Niger is to be 
 found there, and it is par excellence the land of heavy rainfalls. 
 From February to July the water falls from the skies in veritable 
 torrents. The gentle slopes of the mountain ranges are chan- 
 nelled by innumerable cascades, rivulets, brooks, and rivers, that 
 carry oft' the heavenly overflow. It is not surprising, therefore, 
 that at Kouroussa, although the river has received only three 
 tributaries of importance, it has already acquired an imposing 
 bed. The further it advances, the larger and more numerous 
 
A WATERFALL IN THE VALLEY OF THE NIGER'S SOURCE 
 
50 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 become the waters by which it is swelled. These supplies cease 
 abruptly above Bammaku, and from there to Diafaraba the 
 river is almost solitary. 
 
 It is between Tembi-Kuntu and Diafaraba that we meet 
 with the first of a homogeneous series of naturally irrigated 
 zones. The left bank is narrow, and descends in a gentle slope 
 to the Niger, the Foota Jallon range closely bordering and not 
 quitting it until after Koulikoro. The right bank, however, is 
 free, and forms a large plain, which is splendidly watered by the 
 crowd of tributaries that run parallel to the great river. 
 
 The latter does not squander its miracles on this first zone, 
 which is already so richly dowered with precious waters that its 
 co-operation would be superfluous. These countries of the 
 Upper Niger are radiant. Tropical vegetation spreads over 
 them with the utmost prodigality, its orange, citron, kola, and 
 banana trees delighting the eyes of the European. 
 
 The Niger is accumulating its forces as it crosses this region, 
 and its inundations are unimportant, scarcely overflowing the 
 banks by half a mile. The giant is reserving his strength that 
 he may transform into opulent plains the immense stretches of 
 sand that await his coming from here to Diafaraba. The river 
 pauses for a moment below Bammaku, in front of the rocky 
 barrier of Sotouba, in order to gather up and concentrate, before 
 approaching the sand, the formidable mass of waters sent by 
 the heavens during the previous five months. Then in the 
 plenitude of its strength it rushes on towards the north, passing 
 Nyamina, Segu, and Sansanding on its way. 
 
 Having cleared Diafaraba, it arrives, towards September, 
 impetuous and swollen, at Mopti, where it is joined by a 
 monster tributary, the Bani, with a mass of waters as formidable 
 as its own. With such a reinforcement, the army of waters has 
 
THE VALLEY OF THE NIGER 51 
 
 grown immense, infinite. Its bed is now too narrow, it stifles 
 between the banks. In front, behind, upon all sides, it seeks 
 outlets, hurling itself into the least depression, and invading the 
 smallest passage. And now takes place what I shall call the 
 intoxication of the Niger. 
 
 Happy intoxication ! if such it be. The river flings itself 
 headlong over the entire low-lying region between Diafaraba 
 and Timbuctoo, covering it and swamping it, until a steppe of 
 barren sand becomes one of the most fertile spots in the 
 universe. It has for centuries drifted a beneficent vegetable mud 
 into these low-lying countries, effacing the sand and trans- 
 forming this region into a granary of plenty. We find there 
 not one delta, as in Egypt, but three. 
 
 The first is from Diafaraba to the approaches of Lake Debo. 
 On its left bank, having found two auspicious outlets, the Niger 
 forms the pools of Diarka and Bourgoo. Its principal branch 
 runs in a parallel direction, and flows with its two arms into the 
 Debo. Its waters are still so abundant, in spite of this distri- 
 bution of its forces, that the three streams communicate with 
 one another by means of natural channels. The Bani connects 
 itself with the Niger in the same manner on the right bank. 
 
 Thus a most thorough and complete system of irrigation is 
 formed, to which man has not needed to put his hand ; and 
 fertility is spread over thousands of square miles. The rise and 
 fall of these waters is as regular as those of the Nile, and an 
 infinitely greater distance is covered. At Mopti, for example, 
 you can calculate in September ninety miles from east to west 
 inundated to a depth of eight or nine feet. 
 
 The countries of Sana, Bourgoo, Massina, Jenneri, and Kunari 
 are situated in this delta. 
 
 The second extends from Lake Debo to El Oual Hadj. Here 
 
THE REGION OF THE THREE DELTAS 
 
THE VALLEY OF THE NIGER 53 
 
 the Niger again divides into three branches. The least important, 
 the Koli-Koli, rises south of Lake Debo ; the Barra Issa or Black 
 Niger, and the Issa Ber or White Niger, north of the lake. The 
 Koli-Koli traverses Lake Korienza and joins the Black Niger 
 at Sarafara, the latter being in its turn united with the White 
 Niger near El Oual Hadj. 
 
 Like the Bani and the Niger, like the Niger and the pools 
 of Diarka and Bourgoo, these three branches communicate with 
 one another by means of winding channels, and we find every- 
 where the same system of irrigation accompanied by the same 
 wonderful fertility. Nor is this all. On the left bank, at the 
 extreme limit of inundation, the river finds a new formula for its 
 gifts in an admirable series of lakes, twelve in number, and 
 separated by chains of hills. The following are the names of 
 eleven of them, counting from south-west to north-east : the 
 Kabura, Tenda, Sumpi, Takadji, Sanaki, Horo, Fati, Goro, 
 Dauna, Tela, and the Faguibina. 
 
 The floods fill these lakes by means of gullies more or less 
 wide. Those of the Fati, Horo, and Takadji are particularly 
 wide and open to commerce at any time of the year. Others are 
 clear for certain months (October to March), and are then 
 obstructed by weeds, not, however, to the extent of impeding 
 the passage of small canoes. The borders of these lakes, like 
 the banks of the river they rival in fertility, are alternately 
 flooded and left bare for a distance of some hundreds of yards. 
 
 The lakes of Tela, Faguibina, and Dauna form depressions to 
 a depth of thirty-three feet below the mean level of the Niger. 
 They are fed by means of gullies and subterranean infiltration. 
 At the height of the floods, by simply scraping the ground with 
 your hand, you can find water anywhere on the surface between 
 the river and the lakes. 
 
54 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 This chaplet of lakes forms an ingenious system of reservoirs 
 for the formidable masses of water discharged by the Niger and 
 Bani united. They return a portion of their water by means of 
 gullies and channels as the floods subside. To the second delta 
 belong the countries of Guimbala, Farimanka, Aoussa-Kattawal, 
 Seno Krou-ku, Fituka, and Sobundu-Samba. 
 
 The third delta occupies the valley extending from El Oual 
 Hadj to Khabara, the port of Timbuctoo. After El Oual Hadj 
 the river pursues a solitary course to its mouth. 
 
 This zone of irrigation is formed in the following manner : 
 Numerous natural channels connect the Tela and Faguibina 
 lakes with the left bank of the river, the most important of 
 them going by the name of the Pool of Gundam. On the right 
 bank a new series of lakes and the Pools of Guaki and Kuna 
 are scattered over the north-east of the valley. Unfortunately 
 these lakes are only known by name, but according to the latest 
 information they are twenty-three in number ; among them are 
 the Kangara, Dinaguira, Doumba, Labou, Hongonta, Fatta, 
 Tahetant, Tibouraguina, Do, Gakora, Tengueral, Titoulawina, 
 Agwabada, Garo, Haribongo, Kherba, Tibouraghina, Dadji, 
 Fankora, and the Marmar. 
 
 This delta comprises Kissou, Killi, Surayamo, Aribinda, and 
 Gurma. 
 
 Retarded thus by innumerable and remote digressions, by 
 liberalities great and small, it is not until January that the 
 Niger reaches Timbuctoo. Driven back there by the sands 
 of the Sahara, it takes a sharp turn to the east, the dunes 
 closely following it on the left bank and preventing it from 
 spreading to its full width. On the right bank, however, the 
 country is once more favourable for inundations, and the Niger 
 makes its fertilising power manifest in channels and lakes which 
 
THE VALLEY OF THE NIGER 55 
 
 irrigate the country by natural means and give this Bamba region 
 a widespread reputation for wealth. 
 
 The course of the river to the east is now suddenly arrested by 
 the granite range of Taosay. It forces a narrow passage for 
 a while, and then, wearied with struggling against these rocky 
 masses, it makes straight for the south. Here again the left 
 bank proves inhospitable, while the Niger continues its customary 
 marvellous transformations on the right. Its progress is so 
 greatly retarded here that it is not until the middle of July that 
 it arrives at Say with its full complement of water, and it finally 
 reaches the mouth in September. Nearly a year therefore has 
 it taken this immense mass of water from the regions of the 
 Upper Niger to reach, considerably lessened in bulk, the Atlantic 
 Ocean. 
 
 We have now seen that Nature has neglected nothing to make 
 these southern lands fit to maintain a commerce so important 
 as that of Timbuctoo. Cattle-rearing and agriculture attain to 
 an extreme degree of perfection, and one fondly pictures the 
 wealth that might be drawn from a country so marvellously 
 constructed. 
 
CHAPTER IV 
 
 THE TOWNS OF THE NIGER 
 
 4 PREPARE to receive cavalry ! . . . Mar-r-r-ch ! ' This com- 
 mand uttered in a ringing voice, a clang of arms and a great 
 clatter of feet, were the first sounds I heard on awakening in 
 one of the casemates of Fort Bammaku. Somewhat bewildered, 
 I question my servant, who is squatting in the corner waiting 
 for me to open my eyes. 'It is the soldiers being drilled," he 
 says, and, peeping through one of the loopholes, I see a square of 
 negroes, bristling with bayonets. 
 
 Bammaku is the first fort upon our route that contains 
 military apparatus and a garrison. The critical circumstances 
 under which it was built are curiously reflected in its structure. 
 It is simply a great rectangular wall with none of the ingenuity of 
 modern construction about it ; but a superabundance of loopholes 
 everywhere in the stables, the powder-magazines, the rooms, 
 and the kitchen. They had to build quickly in 1883 and content 
 themselves with the merely necessary ; for Samory was still 
 
 56 
 
THE TOWNS OF THE NIGER 57 
 
 terrorising the country when Colonel Borgnis-Desbordes planted 
 the first French flag upon the Niger. A little troop of infantry 
 intrenched in a neighbouring redoubt held the position while 
 the Chinese hastily raised these primitive fortifications ; the 
 hordes of blacks multiplying the while, and Samory himself 
 coming to command this last and decisive engagement. As 
 ammunition was giving out, the Colonel and his staff joined in 
 the melee. Borgnis-Desbordes, running to repell the last assault, 
 said to his companions, ' Better keep the last charge in your 
 revolvers, for when we have served the rest it will be time to 
 think of ourselves. 1 
 
 If Bammaku is not yet a purely administrative centre, like 
 Bafoulaba, Badumba, and Kita, it is not because this part of the 
 country needs a display of strength (it is no less peaceful than 
 that through which I have just passed), but because it is situated 
 in the very centre of our colony, and forms an important strategic 
 point from which it is easy to send reinforcements to any part 
 that may be momentarily threatened. 
 
 This precaution is wise. For do we really know how far we 
 are masters of this splendid country, which is many times larger 
 than France, and contains from ten to fifteen millions of people ? 
 We have a fleet of two gunboats and some iron barges armed 
 with mitrailleuses, upon the Niger, commanded by a naval lieutenant 
 and a midshipman ; the crew is black, as are all the troops garrison- 
 ing the interior. Except the servers of the field-pieces, there is not 
 a single white private in the country. Officers and petty officers 
 alone are Europeans, and the respective numbers of blacks and 
 whites occupying the immense Sudan are : six hundred Euro- 
 peans, including officers, petty officers, doctors, veterinaries, 
 officials, and telegraph-clerks, and four million negroes enrolled 
 as foot-soldiers, cavalry, and transport-bearers. 
 
58 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 When we realise that we have only occupied this country 
 for the last ten years, and that it is three or four times as large 
 as Algeria (which requires an army of 40,000 men to maintain 
 it), we find the necessary controlling force in the Sudan to be as 
 surprisingly as it is delightfully small. 1 
 
 The town of Bammaku is situated between the fort and the 
 river, not immediately upon its banks but at a distance of a 
 quarter of a mile ; that is to say, on the limits of inundation. 
 Its aspect is most charming, thanks to the initiative and intelli- 
 gence of the officers who have successively commanded it. They 
 have well taken to heart their role of civilising medium, and have 
 made (between its rows of white dwellings built of rammed clay) 
 roads, which they have bordered with trees that give a most 
 welcome shelter. 
 
 They have also laid out great squares where the superbly 
 tall cheese-tree spreads its parasol-like foliage. A large build- 
 ing shelters the native market, and not far from it are two shops 
 containing European merchandise. A negro, armed with an 
 old sabre, acts the part of superintendent of police and looks 
 after the town property. This Europeanising does not displease 
 
 1 This is how our conquest has been organised : The Sudan is divided into regions, 
 the regions into circles, and these again into posts. The first are five in number. 
 The government resides provisionally in the first region, that of Kayes (though logic- 
 ally the centre of the colony should be at Bammaku). Its circles are those of Nioro, 
 Kita, Bafoulaba, and its posts, Selibaba and Gumbu. Other European centres are : 
 Medina, Dinguirai, Dioubaba, and Badumba. Second, the southern region. Centre : 
 Bissandugu (ancient capital of Samory). Circles : Siguiri, Farannah, Erimakono, 
 Kissidugu. Posts : Kankan, Beyla, Kerwana, Kuroussa. Third, the eastern region 
 on the left bank of the river and to the right across the valley of the Niger. Centre : 
 Bammaku. Circle : Bougouni. Posts : Koulikoro and Toulimandio. Fourth, the 
 north-east region on both sides of the river. Centre : Segu. Circles : Jenne, Sokolo, 
 Bandiagara. Posts : Mopti and Gourao on Lake Debo, headquarters of the flotilla. 
 Fifth, the northern region comprising the lakes of the north valley. Centre : 
 Timbuctoo. Circles : Gundam and Sarafara. Post : El Oual Hadj. A superior 
 officer is at the head of each region ; captains administer the circles ; and officers of 
 different grades command the posts.

 the natives in the least. Every year sees the town increase and 
 new roads constructed, while rapid strides are being made towards 
 regaining its ancient prosperity, which was destroyed by El Hadj 
 Omar and Samory out of sheer envy. 
 
 The great encompassing plain is no less enchanting to loko 
 at. Partly inundated and partly irrigated by numerous rivulets, 
 there is no need to dilate upon its obvious fertility, and I pass 
 on to speak at greater length of the three kinds of tree which 
 grow so abundantly in the fields, bush, and rocky ledges of this 
 region. 
 
 The most interesting of the three is the karita or butter-tree, 
 and is best represented among our trees by the pear, the similarity 
 of their leaves being remarkable. The bark and trunk are rugged 
 like those of the chestnut-tree. Its branches develop in the form 
 of a dome, and should attain to great dimensions. A fully 
 developed karita is unfortunately a rare sight; for the natives 
 take no care (in their fields or elsewhere) to preserve this tree, 
 which they have neither to plant nor to cultivate, and whose fruit 
 can always be gathered to satiety. I know no tree in the whole 
 of Western Africa more valuable for the services it renders the 
 native or for those it will soon be called upon to render the 
 European. 
 
 It first attracted my attention at Dion at the close of a day's 
 journey that had been prolonged until nightfall. When we finally 
 reached the village in which we had arranged to spend the night, 
 great was my surprise at inhaling an unmistakable odour of 
 chocolate. Some European has forestalled me, I thought, and 
 I made inquiries for him among the inhabitants. No, not another 
 white man in the place. Whence this delectable odour, then ? 
 Guided by the perfume I presently found a large earthen pot con- 
 fronting me, in which a dark brown mass was boiling. This was 
 
60 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 the karita, and they were boiling its nuts to obtain the butter 
 they yield, and it was thence the well-known fumes escaped. 
 
 This nut is enclosed in a flesh that resembles the peach in 
 taste, and is made into a sweetmeat by the natives. The nut is 
 shelled and set to dry and harden ; in this state its red-brown 
 colour, aroma, and taste are completely analogous to our cocoa. 
 The Sudanese, though not yet initiated into the joys of chocolate, 
 make a very ingenious use of it, nevertheless. They obtain, by a 
 process similar to that of making cocoa-nut butter, a product of 
 the first necessity, vegetable butter ; and throughout the whole of 
 the Sudan no other fatty substance is used, the great white 
 blocks of karita possessing the inestimable advantage of never 
 going bad. 
 
 The European will undoubtedly find a still more profitable 
 use for this tree later on, for on incision it yields a gutta-percha 
 a product for which many industries are now anxiously seeking, 
 for its supply has diminished in proportion to the increase of 
 demand. 
 
 In the neighbourhood of the karita grows another curious 
 tree, the nata. After the butter-tree the flour-tree. This flour, 
 sold in all the markets of the region, is enclosed in large pods ; it 
 is of a yellow colour and singularly rich in sugar, so much so that 
 I have seen it used by Europeans in the manufacture of confec- 
 tionery and pastry. 
 
 It would be difficult to say too much about the third tree 
 found in these parts, the cheese-tree. Not satisfied with pro- 
 viding her negro with butter and pastry, Dame Nature has 
 benevolently adorned the branches of this tree with camenberts 
 and livarots. This tree (called baga or bamanbi by the 
 natives) also produces capsules, from which very fine and brilliant 
 filaments escape. So much do they resemble the precious threads

 of the cocoon that the name of vegetable silk has been given 
 them. Nor is this the only Sudanese plant to furnish this 
 miracle : the follicle of a very abundant anemone is equally full of 
 a lustrous silk ; while in the second delta of the Niger I have 
 frequently observed a large plant growing to about the height of 
 a man and bearing a pretty mauve blossom which is furnished in 
 the same manner. 
 
 The principal articles of commerce sent by Bammaku to 
 Timbuctoo are gold, kola-nuts, karita, and arachides. It would 
 doubtless send cereals and other of its abundant products if the 
 river permitted of direct relations being established between the 
 two cities. 
 
 At a little distance down the Niger, however, its bed is en- 
 cumbered by the great barrier of Sotouba, forming one of the most 
 picturesque scenes in the Sudan. I visited it just at the fall of 
 the waters, and found that a formidable chaos of bitumen-coloured 
 rocks had been uncovered on the left bank, while a terribly swift 
 
THE TOWNS OF THE NIGER 63 
 
 and foaming rapid extended as far as the eye could see upon the 
 right. 
 
 The passage of Sotouba is only practicable at the height of 
 the waters when the rocks are covered and the river is one 
 enormous and very dangerous rapid. The current is so swift 
 that a canoe from Bammaku arrives at Toulimandio, a distance 
 of twenty-five miles, in three hours. At this latter place the 
 course of the river is more normal, and we have made a little 
 harbour from which travellers, bound for the north of the Sudan, 
 come and go. 
 
 It has no garrison, but merely possesses a dwelling of vaguely 
 European type, built of rammed clay and thatched after the 
 fashion of the native hut. A tricolour flag waves from its roof, 
 and under it live an artillery sergeant and a gunner, closely recall- 
 ing the two sappers of Dioubaba ; only, instead of being occupied 
 with trains and playing at station master, the artilleryman is 
 admiral and commander of the fleet of transport barges. 
 
 The two men live surrounded by monkeys, guinea-fowls, and 
 poultry, and their contentment rivals that of the comrades of 
 Bakoy. A youthful alligator supplies the place of the hippo- 
 potamus, but does not display the same amiable desire to be 
 tamed. He would make a mouthful of the hand ill-advised 
 enough to attempt a caress ; he has a strong chain attached to 
 him, and is fastened up like a dog. There is only one thing that 
 troubles these sons of the soil : they cannot understand why 
 the natives do not labour to obtain even greater profit from 
 the rich extents of fertility at their disposal. ' They should send 
 the fools to France to be taught how to work, 1 is their recom- 
 mendation. 
 
 Some ten miles south of Toulimandio we have established a 
 shipyard on a pretty, rocky promontory of the Niger. Its name 
 
2 g H

THE TOWNS OF THE NIGER 65 
 
 is Koulikoro, and its neighbouring forests supply the wood from 
 which the barges are concocted. These boats are something 
 between a whaler and a canoe in shape, and officers, privates, 
 travellers, and stores circulate up and down the river upon them. 
 The director and workmen of the shipyard are all natives of 
 Senegal. 
 
 It is an amusingly primitive and exotic arsenal that is repre- 
 sented upon the river-bank. The workshops are leafy vaults ; and 
 benches, with forges, lathes, and pyramids of planks, lie scattered 
 round the feet of mighty trees. The forms of toiling carpenters, 
 blacksmiths, and sawyers mingle with those of their wives and 
 children washing and bathing in the stream. Horses and other 
 animals browse contentedly near, and the whole forms a delightful 
 babel of laughter, blows of the hammer, neighing, saw-grinding, 
 chatter, and bleating. 
 
 Further on, with Nyamina and Sansanding we reach the cotton 
 district. Large fields are consecrated to the cultivation of this 
 valuable plant, and it is here those beautiful fabrics known as 
 pagnes de Segu are made. They are patterned in deep indigo, 
 and are in great request in Senegal, in the markets of Timbuctoo, 
 and among the inhabitants of the coast, who greatly prefer them 
 to the European textiles. 
 
 Nyamina reposes gracefully at the far end of a little creek on 
 the left bank of the Niger. This town is as gay and animated as 
 possible, possessing, not one, but many markets in which the pro- 
 ducts of this rich country of Sarro are exchanged. Not only is 
 there no fort nor garrison, there is not even a single European 
 here, the government of town and country being in the hands of 
 a native chief. 
 
 Segu, on the contrary, distant two days' journey on the right

 river-bank, is strongly fortified ; partly in its character of ancient 
 bulwark of the Toucouleur dominion and capital of El Hadj 
 Omar, and partly because it is the stronghold of the central valley 
 of the Niger. Seen from the river its appearance is very attractive, 
 with its massive gates and its walls zig-zagging like the folds 
 of a screen. At the far end a conglomeration of points produces 
 the illusion of a strong castle bristling with battlements. This 
 edifice was the fantastic creation of the towrfs first governor, an 
 
 SEGU 
 
 artillery officer, and it lodges the European staff, provision and 
 ammunition stores. Its architect was inspired by the bizarre and 
 vague efforts at adornment on the palaces of the kings of Segu. 
 The ornaments with which they sought to soften the high bare 
 walls which made their palaces look like prisons were, it appears, 
 imported by masons from Jenne. With these models before him, 
 the ingenuity of the artilleryman, combined with negraic masonry, 
 resulted in a very queer product indeed. Seen close, it resembles 
 a porcupine, or some large cathedral organ with a multitude of 
 pipes. Unfortunately the sun-dried bricks of which it is built are 
 inconsistency itself, and every rainy season sees the pilasters melt 
 away like sugar-plums. Alas ! three times over, this curiosity 
 will not live to amuse our sons.

 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 The town is populous, busy, and lively, but its interior does 
 not fulfil the promise of its outward show. It is a pity that no 
 one has taken the trouble to make the vistas and squares that 
 give so much charm to Bammaku. The royal palace is its only 
 
 
 SEGU : THE ANCIENT PALACE OF AHMADOU TRANSFORMED INTO

 object of interest, and of that not much more than the walls 
 have been left standing. The interior has been destroyed 
 and altered to suit our tastes and necessities, and it was 
 but the carcase of Ahmadou^s (son of El Hadj Omar) palace 
 that furnished the artilleryman with a model for his amazing 
 monument. As for the abode of the famous negro conqueror, 
 a cabbage plot grows where his harem was wont to flaunt its 
 black beauty, and a post-office stands upon the site of his 
 treasury. 
 
 This post-office is the last and most northern of the fourteen 
 scattered about the Sudan. Hereafter we shall only find second- 
 hand ones that is to say, a petty officer who ensures the departure 
 
70 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 and delivery of letters in every occupied town. Once a fortnight 
 a French mail arrives and departs timed to reach Dakar the day 
 before the large steamers touch there. These mails, enclosed in 
 waterproof bags, cross the country by means of relays of porter

 being carried in canoes on the Niger at the rate of thirty-five 
 miles a day. 
 
 In addition the Sudan is provided with 1860 miles of telegraph 
 lines. Segu is their northern limit, and it would be tedious to 
 insist upon the value, from the point of view of security alone, 
 of these little threads to a young colony. Not less useful are they 
 as an instrument of public information, a gazette ; a happy innova- 
 tion for countries where newspapers only arrive some months old. 
 Twenty words from France arrive daily in Senegal. This despatch, 
 consisting of a summary of the day's events, is transmitted to 
 Kayes, and from there it is re-telegraphed from office to office 
 across the country. It is communicated by letter to places that 
 
THE TOWNS OF THE NIGER 
 
 71 
 
 have no telegraph. These summaries are written out and attached 
 to the doors of offices and forts throughout the country, and by 
 their means the colonist lives in touch from day to day with 
 the mother-country. 
 
 Sansanding, twelve hours ditsant by the Niger from Segu, is 
 situated, like Nyamina, in a creek on the left bank. There is no 
 soldier or white man here either. 
 
 Besides protecting and governing, we instituted a new form of 
 rule for the Sudan. It was initiated by Colonel Archinard, one of 
 its most intelligent governors. 
 
 Amongst the wise reforms instituted in Senegal by Faid- 
 herbe, the one that rendered most signal service was the establish- 
 ment of the School of Hostages at St. Louis. The sons of kings, 
 kinglets, and the great chiefs of Senegambia are educated there 
 on European lines. They are inoculated with modern culture 
 
 POSTAL CANOE ON THE NIGER 
 
 and ideas, and are taught to share the French hopes and ideals 
 for the future of these vast countries of the Sudan. 
 
 Arrived at manhood, the sons either assist their fathers in a 
 government to which they will succeed, or they enter the Sene- 
 galese or Sudanese services, civil and military. Some are officers, 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 and others are utilised in the administration and telegraph offices, 
 while many fill the important post of interpreter. 
 
 Mademba, son of a chief of Walo (of considerable authority 
 in matters of religion and politics), was educated in this manner. 
 He entered the telegraphic department somewhere about 1868, and 
 rendered devoted service for twenty years to the cause of French 
 occupation. He followed Colonel Borgnis-Desbordes and Colonel 
 Archinard in their respective expeditions up the Niger; and the 
 latter, wishing to reward his devotion, created for him a little king- 
 dom on the left bank of the river, with Sansanding as his capital. 
 
 This idea of governing the negroes of the Sudan by a Senegalese 
 negro educated in accordance with our ideas was a lucky hit. It 
 
 is a living and daily example 
 to these people, an encourage- 
 ment to them to receive the 
 education we offer. When we 
 fy'[ remember with what modest 
 
 means we occupy the Sudan, 
 we recognise how inestimable 
 this moral force of education 
 must be. 
 
 When the commanders of 
 neighbouring forts have occa- 
 ffi sion to collect provisions of 
 
 cereals, recruit tirailleurs, as-

 semble porters, or no matter 
 
 what, they can rely upon Mademba as they would upon a 
 European. Any white man passing through Sansanding, what- 
 ever his position may be, receives the welcome of a friend. If you 
 appeal to his assistance, even after only having once seen him, 
 Mademba will perform the impossible in order to serve you.

 Although a Mussulman himself, he so appreciates the benefits he 
 received from a European education, that he sends his sons to the

 of St. Louis, sub- 
 scribes to our 
 papers, and keeps

 and politics of 
 France. Colonial ENTRANCE TO MADEMBA'S PALACE 
 
 movement more especially engages his attention, and he gives 
 it practical encouragement in his kingdom. He sends to Paris 
 for various seeds, and endeavours to introduce new growths into 
 the country. He has an experimental garden on the banks of 
 the Niger, and I have seen corn, and plum and peach trees, etc., 
 trying to grow there. The natives have noticed all this, and 
 respect him accordingly. 'Mademba is not a negro/ they say, 
 4 he is a tou bab ** (European), not meaning by this that he 
 has renounced his race and colour, but to express their pride in 
 the fact that one of their number has raised himself to the level 
 of those white men whose culture is their perpetual astonishment. 
 The Europeans indorse this judgment and treat him in every 
 way as one of themselves. I need scarcely say that I passed 
 many interesting hours at the court of King or, as the natives 
 say, Fama Mademba. A most diverting mixture of European 
 and native customs obtains there. His house is built in a 
 succession of courts cut in battlements, and the whole is 
 enclosed with high walls after the fashion of native palaces. 
 It is at one and the same time a farm, barracks, country house, 
 and royal dwelling, just like the kingly palaces of Homer. In 
 the first court you pass through groups of horses, women, 
 sheep, children, and ducks and hens ; in the second, clusters of 
 
 F 
 
74 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 servants, armed or otherwise, are measuring rice and millet seed, 
 or selling barrels of salt, tobacco, and kola-nuts. In Mademba's 
 own apartments, amongst the skins spread about on the floor 
 for the accommodation of a native audience, were comfortable 
 arm-chairs, tables, books, pen and ink, lamps and candlesticks, 
 a thousand objects trifling in themselves but interesting enough 
 when found under a negro's roof. 
 
 Mademba has retained the religion of his father, and most 
 of his subjects practise Islamism. Although discarding some of 
 its usages, he has preferred to preserve the custom of polygamy. 
 
 Towards evening, as the mares and colts were brought in 
 from the fields under his vigilant eyes, I sat beside him with my 
 
 glass of water 
 perfumed with 
 some drops of 
 absinthe ; and 
 melancholy were 
 
 A COURTYARD IN MADEMBA'S PALACE 
 
 the glances he 
 
 cast upon his own ' undefiled tumbler. 1 His retinue was 
 numerous, and he had too much tact to scandalise them by 
 drinking his water anything but neat, nor did he neglect 
 to prostrate himself in the prayer that every good Mussulman 
 must say at sunset. But no sooner did we find ourselves 
 tete-a-tete at dinner, waited on by familiar servants (Senegalese 
 like their master), than red wine and champagne from the 
 royal cellars filled both our tumblers, nor was a final glass of 
 Chartreuse forgotten. The repast was served in European 
 fashion, plates and knives being changed with each course, a 
 little luxury I had not always met with in the Sudan at the 
 tables of white people. In contrast to all this, the wardrobe 
 of the king retained its local colour. He wore a red fez and 
 
THE TOWNS OF THE NIGER 
 
 75 
 
 a long mantle (like the priestly cope), dark green in colour and 
 heavily embroidered in gold. He wore, moreover, various decora- 
 tions, among which I noticed that of the legion of honour. I 
 will not deny that 
 he had something 
 of the stage mon- 
 arch about him and 
 might have come 
 out of a theatrical 
 wardrobe-shop, but 
 his appearance was 
 in no way inhar- 
 monious ; and how 
 ridiculous he would 
 have looked in 
 frock-coat and top- 
 hat ! 
 
 Having scoured 
 the country for so 
 many years, and 
 being by nature an 
 observer gifted with 
 a keen judgment, 
 Mademba was a 
 perfect treasure- 
 house of information. He had a complete knowledge of native 
 idioms, and could express himself in French with ease. He gave 
 me an account of the ancient splendour of Sansanding, and entered 
 into the reasons of its decadence, recounted his heroic resistance 
 against the Toucouleurs, and showed me how he was slowly 
 rebuilding his kingdom. The explanation of many things came 
 
 FAMA MADEMBA 
 
76 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 to me in this way : the speedy submission of the Sudan, and, above 
 all, its rapid pacification, and the security of completely isolated 
 Europeans, like the two artillerymen at Toulimandio. 
 
 Mademba sent for a chief of the town in order that I might 
 receive enlightenment at the fountain-head. He was an old 
 man, Bossissa by name, withered and whitened by age, whose 
 energies had all ebbed into his eyes. His grandfather was the 
 most powerful shipowner in Sansanding a hundred years ago ; 
 the greater part of the canoes trading with Timbuctoo were his, 
 and his slaves were to be counted by hundreds. Mungo Park 
 was his guest in 1805, and his descendants have preserved 
 more than one reminiscence of the hardy explorer which shall be 
 recounted later on. 
 
 4 Thou hast seen our city in ruins," said Bossissa ; ' its houses 
 deserted and falling in pieces. Thou hast beheld our most un- 
 happy Mosque. And when thou shalt be returned into the 
 country of thy fathers, thou shalt say : I have seen Sansancling, 
 and it is a city in ruins, a city of nothingness. But yet thou 
 hast not seen our city, neither has the Fama beheld it. This 
 beard and these white hairs alone have seen it. And at that 
 time the city was cheerful and well built, containing many 
 markets. The people were full of contentment, and were 
 apparelled in the fine garments and rich clothing of Arabia 
 which were brought by our canoes from Timbuctoo, together 
 with many things both beautiful and pleasant. All this suffered 
 sudden change forty years ago. It was the will of God ! Men 
 came from the south hungered and thirsting for blood, as the 
 hyena comes seeking corpses. El Hadj Omar was at their head. 
 From the west he brought them, saying unto them : " The Djoliba 
 takes its source in Mecca. To look upon it is to make a 
 pilgrimage unto the Holy City. All who bathe in it shall be 
 
THE TOWNS OF THE NIGER 
 
 77 
 
 received in Paradise." We were good Mussulmans here, but they 
 made war against us for the sake of our wealth. We fought 
 long, and conquered many times, but our city was taken from us 
 and set in ruins. Our people left their country. My friends 
 wished me to depart also, but I made answer, " I will rather 
 
 m s

 die where my father died." A life of sadness began. The 
 Toucouleurs destroyed and pillaged ; many of the inhabitants 
 had nothing left to them but their two ears. The fields were 
 no longer cultivated. The country returned to the bush, and 
 wild animals peopled it. Hyaenas came to 'our very doors and 
 
78 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 carried away our children in the twilight. Then the Frenchmen 
 came, and Segu was destroyed, and the Toucouleurs were swept 
 away, and joy returned to the country. Peace reigns among 
 us ; he who does evil is of a certainty punished. Now that the 
 harvest is no longer stolen, the fields are once more cultivated. 
 We can travel without fear; a child, knowing its way, may 
 walk alone along the roads. Merchants sleep in safety in the 
 bush far from all habitations ; while, formerly, we did not dare 
 to go beyond the town. When we met others stronger than 
 ourselves, they seized us and made us their slaves. The weak 
 village was at the mercy of the powerful. But to-day all are 
 equal and contented, and one may not do wrong unto another. 
 
 ' It is to the white man that we owe this ; and dost thou still 
 ask why we are satisfied with their presence and wherefore we 
 rejoice in it? Dost thou not now understand why the country 
 submits unto thee and is peaceful ?' 
 
CHAPTER V 
 
 JENNE 
 
 AT the village of Kouakoru we abandoned the Niger for one of 
 those natural channels which carry fertility afar by their floods. 
 
 About twelve hours after we had left the main stream, to my 
 sudden astonishment, the Bosos in the bow abruptly ceased plying 
 their long bamboo poles. Sheltered as I was under my thatched 
 hollow, the horizon was completely hidden from me, and I could 
 see nothing but water and raised banks. Unable to understand 
 their sudden inaction, I prepared to blow them up. They turned 
 at my appeal in open-mouthed surprise, silently pointing to 
 some object that was invisible to me ; then, with voices barely 
 audible from emotion, they murmured, ' Jenne ! ' They were 
 overwhelmed by the sight of an unknown town ; they, who knew 
 great cities like Segu, Nyamina, and Sansanding ! Here was 
 something that I had never seen before, either, and shall never 
 see again, namely, a negro surprised and affected, not by some 
 
European invention, but by a spectacle of his own country. I 
 hastened forward, and stood astonished in my turn ; for the first 
 time in these regions I was astounded by the work of man. 
 
 Curious and beautiful sights had not been wanting on my 
 journey, but there was always something lacking to the eye and 
 mind of a cultivated man, some trace of civilisation that should 
 evoke the genius of humanity; for, in spite of all that has been 
 said about the mutilations and sacrileges to which man has 
 subjected the great works of nature, one must confess to find- 
 ing these great works somewhat incomplete when one has seen 
 nothing else for a long time. The valley of the Loire, clothed 
 solely in its own virgin robe, is a beautiful sight, but set with 
 those precious stones called Amboise, Tours, Chambord, Chenon- 
 ceau,x, it becomes marvellous. 
 
 Jenne is the jewel of the valley of the Niger. 
 
 Here is the picture engraved upon my memory as I sat 
 perched in the bow among my Bosos. A vast plain, infinitely 
 flat, without a touch of relief ; no villages nor any other sign of 
 humanity, only now and again some trees at long intervals, 
 
 si 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 showing as dark spots upon the yellow-green expanse. In the 
 very midst of this solitude is a circle of water, and within it, 
 rising victorious (like the summit of the palm-tree amidst the 
 
 
 sands of the desert), is reared a long mass of high and regular 
 walls, erected on mounds as high, and nearly as steep, as them- 
 selves. A forest of projections crowns them with terraced roofs, 
 palms, gable-ends, stairs, and dome-like trees ; a whole smiling 
 life salutes me from the height of this little island. 
 
 It is sunset, and the violent contrast of tropical light and 
 shade intensifies the effect. It is an impressive scene at this 
 hour, and fully justifies the emotion of my Bosos. The high 
 mass of the town is dark against the sky and the bare immensity 
 of the plain that flames right and left of it ; and Jenne stands 
 out without transition from the brilliance of land and sky. It 
 seems as if all there was of life had sought refuge on this 
 mountain isle which rises protectingly and majestically from the 
 distance. 
 , As my boat approaches by the channel that branches at 
 
JENNE 83 
 
 right angles towards the heart of the town, the banks and walls 
 of the city emerge in greater proportions from the encircling 
 water. At their feet I can distinguish a harbour filled with large 
 boats that have nothing in common with the accustomed pirogue. 
 They are large and strange in form, like the city that shelters 
 them. 
 
 When I have climbed the banks and entered the walls, my 
 surprise takes a definite form, and I am completely bewildered and 
 thrown out of reckoning by the novelty and strangeness of the 
 town^s interior. Surely the angel of Habakkuk has suddenly 
 transported me a thousand leagues away from the Sudan. For 
 it is not in the heart of a country of eternally similar huts 
 (childish in their simplicity and confusion) that I should look to 
 find a real town. Yes, a real town in the European sense of the 
 
 JENNE : A CORNER OF THE TOWN 
 
 word ; not one of those disorderly conglomerations of dwellings 
 which we call towns in this country. Here are true houses ; not 
 primitive shelters crowned with roofs that are either flat or in the 
 
84 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 shape of an inverted funnel. Streets too ; not seed-plots of 
 buildings amongst which one wanders by paths that serpentine 
 more than the most serpentining serpent. 
 
 The idea suddenly occurs to me, perhaps this is Timbuctoo 
 after all. That would explain everything. But it is impossible ; 
 the Bosos say we are still twelve days' journey distant from there. 
 
 What is this town, then, with its wide, straight roads, its 
 houses of two stories (some with a sketch of a third) built in a 
 style that instantly arrests the eye ? I am completely bewildered 
 by an apparition so absolutely unexpected in the midst of a 
 barbarous country. Where did this gathering of unknown life 
 come from ? What is this civilisation, sufficiently assured to

 possess a manner and style of its own ? My thoughts naturally 
 turn to the culture of the Khalifs : the Arabian countries are 
 those nearest to the valley of the Niger, and Islamism is diffused

 among them. But logically a creed should be accompanied by its 
 art, and there is nothing Arabic in this style. There is no trace 
 in any of the houses, old or new, of the cupola which is such a

 characteristic commonplace of Egypt, Syria, and Algeria. These 
 buildings have as little in common with the airy palaces of Cairo 
 and Damascus as they have with the delicate and complicated 
 structures of Cordova, Granada, or Seville. This style is not 
 Byzantine, Roman, nor Greek ; still less is it Gothic or Western. 
 All traces of European civilisation cease between the coast and 
 the Niger.

 At last I recall these majestically solid forms ; and the memory 
 is wafted to me from the other extremity of Africa. Their 
 prototypes rise upon the banks of another great river, but no life 
 is associated with their image. They are dead cities, or 
 rather cities of the dead ; for it is in the lifeless towns of the 
 Pharaohs and their hypogeums, it is in the ruins of ancient 
 Egypt in the valley of the Nile, that I have witnessed this art 
 before.

 How came it here across the far-off centuries ? How is it 
 it adorns a living town to-day ? What is this hitherto unnoticed 
 Egyptian colony ? 
 
 The key to this enigma must be found, and I interrupted my 
 journey, firmly resolved not to resume it before I had unravelled 
 the mystery. I succeeded in fathoming the riddle by means of 
 long talks with the chiefs, notabilities, and marabuts (learned 
 men and Mussulman priests) of the town. Arabic documents

 supplemented oral traditions, and, above all, I had the good 
 fortune to find a complete copy of the Tarik e* Soudan (long 
 coveted by Orientalists), the great chronicle of the countries of 
 the Niger. I completed and elucidated many of its pages by 
 
 A STREET IN JENNE 
 
 means of the narratives transmitted from father to son ; and, 
 little by little, the mystery unfolded. In the next chapter I 
 shall show how the beneficent influence of Egypt, mother of all 
 our western civilisation, penetrated the heart of the negro

 country ; and by what means a reflection of its culture spread 
 and survived unto our day, containing in its afterglow all the 
 glory and vivid charm of the tropical twilight. 
 
CHAPTER VI 
 
 THE SONGHOIS 
 
 IN travelling from the coast the European passes through suc- 
 cessive native tribes of Western Africa: Cereres, Oualofs, 
 Khassonkas, Soussons and Bambaras, etc., all more or less 
 thick-lipped, woolly-headed, flat-nosed, and barbarous, and all 
 equally well known to the ethnographer. 
 
 But arrived at Jenne the traveller finds himself face to face 
 with an entirely new ethnographical entity, namely, the Songhois. 
 Most Europeans miscall them the Sonrhais, but the natives refuse 
 to recognise the word disfigured in this fashion. During the 
 whole forty years in which the interior of Africa has occupied 
 the attention of the world, the name has only appeared before 
 us once. Among ancient geographers Leon the African alone 
 has mentioned them, and that in a paragraph of two 
 lines ! Among moderns, the famous German traveller Barth 
 mentions them at greater length, but all his remarks are 
 wrongly based, for he reckons the Songhois among the abori- 
 ginals of the Sudan, and places their cradle between Tindirma 
 and the Dira, to the south-west of Timbuctoo. Quite other is 
 the tradition of the Songhois themselves. They invariably told 
 me that they did not originate in the countries of the Niger, 
 and when questioned concerning the home of their fathers they 
 all gave the same reply. The right arm of the human docu- 
 
90 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 ment was raised, flinging back the numerous white draperies that 
 serve as clothing, and a black hand pointed unhesitatingly in 
 the direction of the purple dawn. It was their unvarying response 
 in Jenne or elsewhere, and it was never the west, where Tin- 
 dirma and Dira lie, that they indicated, but always the east. 
 Once again was that great law of the migrations of peoples con- 
 firmed, which draws the nations from the land of the rising to 
 that of the setting sun. 
 
 After the human documents I consulted the written, and 
 among all the historical manuscripts collected in my travels the 
 only one to refer to the origin of the Songhois is the Tarik. 
 
 It must be attentively read, too, for its most precious indi- 
 cations are very concisely enclosed. ' The first king of the 
 Songhois, 1 it says, ' was called Dialliaman. His name comes 
 from the Arabian Dm mm al Jemen, signifying " He is come from 
 Yemen." Dialliaman, 1 the narrative continues, ' quitted Yemen 
 in company with his brother. They travelled through the country 
 of God until destiny brought them to the land of Kokia. 
 
 ' Now Kokia was a town of the Songhois people situated on 
 the banks of a river, and was very ancient. It existed in the 
 time of the Pharaohs, and it is said that one of them, during 
 his dispute with Moses, sent thither for the magician whom he 
 opposed to the Prophet. 
 
 ' The two brothers reached the town in such a terrible state 
 of distress that their appearance was scarcely human ; their skins 
 were cracked by the heat and dust of the desert, and they were 
 almost naked. The inhabitants questioned them concerning the 
 country of their origin, and their names have been forgotten in 
 the surname with which their reply provided them, " Dia min al 
 Jemen " " Come from Yemen." And Dialliaman the elder settled 
 in Kokia. Now the god of the Songhois was a fish who appeared 
 
THE SONGHOIS 91 
 
 to them from the water at certain periods, wearing a golden 
 ring in his nose; and the people gathered together and wor- 
 shipped the fish, receiving its commands and prohibitions and 
 obeying its oracles. 
 
 ' Perceiving their error, Dialliaman hid in his heart a resolution 
 to kill the false deity, and God assisted him in his design. 
 
 ' One day he pierced the fish with a lance in the presence of 
 the people and killed it. Then the people proclaimed Dialliaman 
 king. 1 
 
 We thus learn that the Songhois possessed, at a time which 
 we will determine later, a very ancient town called Kokia that 
 was situated near a river. Now where was this town ? Barth 
 sought for it on his journey from Lake Chad to the Niger, 
 and placed it upon the banks of the Eastern Niger, though he 
 would assuredly never have found it there. 
 
 We will now appeal to oral tradition. With the Tarik in 
 my hand I questioned the Songhois concerning the whereabouts 
 of this city of Kokia. ' The city of Kokia was far, very far away 
 in the east, beyond Gao,' was their unanimous reply ; and upon 
 two occasions the marabuts added, ' It was a town in the country 
 of Misr. 1 Now in the Sudan the country of Misr means Egypt, 
 the valley of the Nile, and the name comes from Misra, signify- 
 ing Cairo. 
 
 What river do we find in the map east of Gao ? None, large 
 or small, but the Nile; and it is in Egypt alone that Kokia, 
 4 situated near a great river, 1 could have existed. Moreover, this 
 will explain why the author said, to indicate the great antiquity 
 of the town, 'it already existed in the time of the Pharaohs,' 
 and that 'one of them sent thither for magicians to defeat 
 Moses. 1 It would probably be a neighbouring and vassal country 
 to which they would apply for them. 
 
92 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 Again, Yemen is not far from the valley of the Nile, and the 
 journey of Dialliaman from there to Kokia 1 is quite plausible. 
 The passage of the desert that separates the Nile from the Red 
 Sea would amply explain the condition in which he is depicted 
 to have arrived. 
 
 It now remains to be proved at what period and in what 
 
 l\ 
 
 HOUSES IN JENNE 
 
 manner the Songhois passed from the shores of the Nile to those 
 of the Niger. The reconstruction of their exodus is, unfortunately., 
 not so simple as the demonstration of their origin, but the follow- 
 ing version seems to be the most probable. 
 
 1 It would probably be necessary, in order to identify Kokia with a town of the 
 Nile valley, to find one built upon an island like the two principal Songhois towns, 
 Jenne and Gao. The Tarik mentions a town of the same name existing in the six- 
 teenth century south of Gao, but it can have no connection with the Kokia at present 
 under discussion. The name was probably given to it by the Songhois in memory 
 of their first home ; if indeed the town really had this name, and it is not an error 
 of the copyists. 
 
THE SONGHOIS 93 
 
 The emigrations must have begun towards the middle of the 
 seventh century, for Jenne was founded one hundred and fifty 
 years after the Hegira (about 765 of our era), and Jenne is the 
 extreme western point of their invasion. From a hundred to a 
 hundred and twenty years would be a sufficient length of time 
 to include the years of wandering and those of settlement and 
 occupation in the Songhoi countries. 
 
 The tranquillity of Egypt (which had lasted since the Roman 
 conquest) was rudely disturbed in the seventh century by the 
 lieutenants of the first Khalifs ; and the country received a shock 
 that would fully justify such an exodus. The conquerors were 
 dazzled by the richness of these territories, as the letter sent by 
 Amru to the Khalif Omar amply proves. It was a magnificent 
 quarry to the starveling Arab, and the distress of the vanquished 
 must have been in proportion to the enthusiasm of the conquerors. 
 The Lower, Upper, and Middle Egypts were all overrun towards 
 the year 640. Possibly the Songhois suffered more than others 
 from this invasion. Perhaps they refused to receive Islamism. 
 My learned friends, the marabuts, being the official representa- 
 tives of Mohammedanism, would naturally not have admitted this 
 reason, and the historical manuscripts are dumb upon the subject. 
 Their compilers of three centuries ago were likewise marabuts, 
 and the silence of both is very likely to have been actuated by 
 the same motive. In any case, the habitual methods of the 
 conquering Arabs, their brutality and cupidity, would in them- 
 selves sufficiently account for the flight of a people as peaceful 
 and industrious as the Songhois have remained to this day. 
 
 Was Dialliaman the promoter and leader of this emigration ? 
 The character would harmonise with the picture the Tarik has 
 drawn of the adventurer who raised himself to the throne of a 
 country he had entered naked and hungry. His native land was 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 Yemen, the recent birthplace and centre of the Mohammedan 
 religion. He may have quarrelled with the early disciples of the 
 Prophet, or he may have quitted Arabia in order to escape the 
 violence of their propaganda. Finding himself once more face 
 to face with the fanatics in the country of his adoption, he 
 would naturally resolve upon a new exile to more remote 
 countries, and would depart, accompanied not merely by his 
 brother, but leading a whole people with him. 
 
 However that may be, Dialliaman, the intrepid traveller and 
 adventurer that the chronicle shows him to be Dialliaman, the 
 true Arab who changes his country as easily as his coat, was in 
 every way fitted to be the leader of a people driven by cruel 
 conquest to seek a new home in a far-off land. The route taken 
 
 MAP OF THE SONGHOI EMIGRATION 
 
 by the emigrants, keeping south of the Libyan desert, passing 
 by Agades and the north of Lake Chad, would meet the Niger 
 somewhere near Gao. They would naturally follow the outskirts 
 of the desert, as the line of less dense population would be that 
 least likely to impede their progress. In this manner they would 
 
THE SONGHOIS 95 
 
 reach the Niger, in spite of the enormous tract of land to be 
 covered, in a comparatively short time. Several details favour 
 this theory. A language similar to that of the Songhois is 
 spoken at Agades, the people bordering the desert between the 
 Chad and the Niger are also Songhoi ; and there is no doubt 
 that many more analogous ethnographical and linguistic traits 
 will be found to exist when the countries lying between Lake 
 Chad and the Nile are better known, 
 
 Finally, in the country of Bourrousu, near the city of Gao, 1 
 local tradition preserves the arrival in these parts of an Egyptian 
 Pharaoh, who is probably none other than Dialliaman, or the 
 leader of the Songhoi emigration. 
 
 Before tracing the development of this new country of 
 the Songhois, I will enforce the arguments in favour of their 
 Egyptian origin by others no less decisive. The great name of 
 Barth, with whom I am in opposition, seems to compel this 
 digression. 
 
 The narratives of the famous traveller serve to confirm these 
 very suppositions, for he is continually finding Egyptian traces 
 in the Songhoi countries and in their countries alone. He observes, 
 in fact, that ' the Songhois seemed to have received their civilisa- 
 tion from Egypt and to have maintained very close relations 
 with her, as many very interesting details show." After that, 
 what would not his conclusions have been if he had visited Jenne 
 itself and seen the character of her architecture ; or if he had 
 gained his facts from the intelligence and science of the Songhois 
 themselves instead of relying upon the information of the Kountas, 
 his hosts at Timbuctoo, who were strangers of comparatively 
 recent date in the country ? 
 
 He recognised the influence of Egypt, but not in its direct

96 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 relation, and he believed its civilisation had been received through 
 the medium of the Mohammedan religion ! Now, at the date of 
 the appearance of Islamism in the Sudan (which was towards 
 the eleventh century) the civilisation of the Pharaohs had been 
 dethroned for nearly four hundred years by that of the Khalifs. 
 It is hardly possible that the apostles of a new and essentially 
 exclusive cult would have imported and established the manners 
 of ancient Egypt in preference to those of contemporary and 
 Arabian Egypt, which was at that time at the height of its 
 prosperity. It follows therefore that the direct relation with 
 Egypt must have been instituted prior to the appearance of 
 Islamism. The strength of the connection, in spite of the enor- 
 mous distance which separates the valley of the Nile from that of 
 the Niger, plainly indicates a direct relation. The current that 
 flowed so persistently and strongly between Egypt and the Sudan 
 up to the sixteenth century represents something more than 
 a merely commercial interest ; it reveals the route of an exodus. 
 The influence and commerce of Morocco and Algeria in the 
 Sudan (countries comparatively near) were for a long time over- 
 powered by distant Egypt. We find undeniable proofs of this 
 among the ancient geographers. Ibn Batouta, a Moor, who 
 visited the countries of the Niger in 1352, relates that at Oualata 
 ' the greater part of the inhabitants wore the beautiful costumes 
 of Egypt. 1 Now Oualata is only two months' journey distant 
 from Morocco, while the valley of the Nile is at a distance of at least 
 eight months. Again, to destroy the powerful and traditional 
 bias of Egypt towards the Niger and establish the preponderance 
 of the northern countries of Africa would require no less than a 
 Moorish occupation in 1592. 
 
 The Songhois themselves furnish further proof that they were 
 originally strangers in the country. Their speech is totally 
 
THE SONGHOIS 97 
 
 different from the numerous Sudanese dialects, and its roots are 
 those of the languages of the Nile. Moreover, their physical type 
 owns nothing in common with that of the West African negro. 
 In the most mixed group of negroes a Songhois may be identified 
 at the first glance ; his skin is as black as theirs, certainly, but 
 nothing in his mask conforms to their well-known characteristics. 
 The nose of the Songhois is straight and long, pointed rather than 
 flat ; the lips are comparatively thin, and the mouth wide rather 
 than prominent and broad ; while the eyes are deeply set and 
 straight in their orbit. A cursory glance shows that the profile 
 resembles that of the European, and one is struck by the remark- 
 able intelligence of their physiognomy and expression. In addi- 
 tion, they are tall, well-made, and slender. 
 
 These peculiarities are still more noticeable among children 
 between six and ten years of age. Their skins are less pro- 
 foundly black than are those of other infant negroes, and the 
 regularity of their features is even more remarkable than in 
 the adult. Many a time I have been arrested by the sight of a 
 group of children in Jenne and charmed by their rare beauty. 
 They seemed to be deeply bronzed children of the race of Shem 
 rather than of Ham. In short, the Songhois recalls the Nubian 
 rather than the West African negro, and I have studied both at 
 leisure. Ethnography, then, assists us in determining the point 
 of departure of the emigration from the valley of the Nile. 
 
 It is to the south of the island of Philae that we find a 
 similar race, and there also has ancient Egypt left indelible 
 traces. On the left bank of the river she has set up a magnifi- 
 cent series of her most characteristic monuments, and it is small 
 wonder that its inhabitants should be so strongly imbued with 
 them that they preserved the vision to the furthest point of their 
 wanderings. 
 
 H

 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 This point was Gao, as we have already seen. Quitting a 
 country of such numerous waters as Nubia, the emigrants would 
 naturally, before settling, seek a situation that would recall the 
 land of their birth in its external conformation ; less from 
 pious memories, perhaps (patriotism is always the latest virtue 
 acquired by a race), than from a desire to continue to live accord- 
 ing to their customs and special aptitudes. For a great distance 
 their route would appear singularly unpropitious, for much sand 
 and little water was not what they wanted, and they would not 
 settle in any quantities between the Nile and the Niger. 
 
 But at Gao they would find a river which would recall the 
 shores they had left, and whose rise and fall fertilised the country 
 in the same manner. Here they could resume their accustomed 
 methods of labour and cultivation ; and, like Barth, they would 
 doubtless be charmed by the beautiful vegetation, containing the 
 date, tamarind, and sycamore trees of their mother-country. 
 And so they fixed their capital at Gao, where they could think 
 
 for the first time 
 of definite repose, 
 and where their 
 hope of a new 
 home was realised. 
 Half the valley 
 of the Niger they 
 made their own, 
 finding only a 
 feeble and patient 
 aboriginal population there, which has almost disappeared to-day. 
 These people, the Habais, are so timid that they arm themselves 
 with bows and arrows to work in fields which are surrounded by 
 their own villages, and then prefer running away to using their

 weapons. Occupation was therefore an easy matter to the Songhois. 
 They founded Jenne, their most western territory, in 765, and made 
 it the market of their empire. We may conclude their dominion to 
 have attained its normal and present boundaries towards the end 
 of the eighth century. These limits comprise the countries from 
 the east of Gao to Lake Chad, and that portion of the valley of 
 the Niger below Jenne and Say. The Sahara bounds them in the 
 north, the empire of the Mali in the west, and the countries 
 of the Bambaras, the Mossi, and the Sokoti in the south ; while 
 the vague regions between Agades and Lake Chad limit them 
 in the east. 
 
 We will now take a rapid survey of the history of the 
 Songhois and the considerable place their empire held in the 
 Sudan during a period of nearly a thousand years. It comprised 
 three dynasties, the Dia, the Sunni, and the Askia, and was not 
 without its hours of glory. 
 
 The prefix of the Dia was borrowed from Dialliaman, 
 but the Sudanese annals are silent concerning their employ- 
 ment of the six hundred years that contained their reigns 
 (700 to 1335) ; and we only know that they numbered thirty 
 in all. 1 
 
 1 A record of their names is immaterial, but I append it, thinking to please the 
 orientalists, who will thus be enabled to read them for the first time as they are pro- 
 nounced by the Songhois. 
 
 Dialliaman's successors were : Dia Arkai, Dia Atka'i, Dia Akkai, Dia Akkou, 
 Dia Alfa'i, Dia Biagoumai, Dia Bi, Dia Kira, Dia Aum Karawai', Dia Aum Sumaiam, 
 Dia Aum Danka, Dia Kiobogo, Dia Koukoura'i, Dia Kenken ; these were idolaters. 
 The sixteenth king, reigning towards the year 1000 of our era, was converted to 
 Islamism in 1010, and since then all the Songhoi princes have been Mussulmans. 
 The list of names continues without incident up to Dia Sobo'i : Dia Koussai Daria, 
 Dia Hin Koronou Goudam, Dia Bia Koni Kimi, Dia Binta Say, Dia Bia Kama 
 Kamba, Dia Kama Siniobo, Dia Tip, Dialliaman Diago, Dia AH Korr, Dia Berr 
 Faloco, Dia Sibo'i, Dia Dourou, Dia Kabaro, Dia Bissi Baro, Dia Bada. 
 
100 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 In the reign of Dia Soboi the Songhoi kingdom experienced 
 its first crisis, becoming the vassal of its neighbour of the west, the 
 Mali empire, then at the height of its glory. In addition to this 
 an army of the Mossi crossed the valley to pillage Timbuctoo, 
 and succeeded in separating Jenne from the main body of the 
 empire (1329). 
 
 Dia Sobof s two sons, Ali Kolon and Suliman Nare, were taken 
 to the court of Kqnkour-Moussa. ' For it was, and is still, the 
 custom in the Sudan for a monarch to be served by the children 
 of his vassals,' says the Tarik. ' Some were permitted to return 
 to their native countries after a certain time, but others lived in 
 bondage to the end of their days.' The young Songhoi princes 
 were detained for a long period at the court of Konkour-Moussa, 
 but Ali Kolon travelled through the kingdom of the Mali from 
 time to time under the pretext of increasing its revenues and 
 augmenting its commerce. , He was an intelligent youth, full of . 
 prudence, reflection, and enlightenment. By prolonging each 
 journey a little further he learned to know the roads of the 
 country, and, above all, those leading towards Songhoi. At last 
 he determined in his heart to return to his native land, and 
 for this purpose he collected stores of arms and provisions, which 
 he concealed along the route he intended to take. Having 
 confided his plan to his brother, they began to train their horses, 
 feeding them well and accustoming them to endure great fatigue. 
 One day they took their departure. When the news of their 
 flight came to the king's ears he commanded them to be pursued 
 and killed ; but although they were overtaken, they defended 
 themselves so well that they were enabled to reach the country 
 of the Songhois. 
 
 Ali Kolon was proclaimed king and given the name of ' Sunni, 
 the Liberator.' 
 
THE SONGHOIS 
 
 101 
 
 Such is the history of the founder of the second dynasty, which 
 lasted from 1355 to 1492, and counted eighteen kings. 1 
 
 Freed by Ali Kolon from the dominion of the Mali, the 
 Songhois resumed the peaceable existence they seemed to have 
 led in the preceding centuries. 
 
 The history of the Songhois takes a wider range with Sunni 
 Ali (1464 to 1493). They now overflow their earlv boundaries

 Sunni All is pre-eminently the soldier ; the true negro soldier, 
 who marches from conquest to conquest absorbing all the popu- 
 lations in war, and so absorbed in it himself that he has no 
 time to create and organise his conquests in durable form. He 
 is an old soldier solely occupied with plunder and prisoners and 
 the levying of tribute. Nevertheless, while fighting from east to 
 west during twenty years, he is unconsciously laying the founda- 
 tions of Songhoi greatness ; and the ground being thus prepared, 
 it is not long before an organiser appears who speedily raises the 
 glory and prosperity of the empire to their greatest height. 
 
 The career of Ali the Conqueror started in masterly fashion 
 with the conquest of Timbuctoo in 1469. It is somewhat sur- 
 prising that we have not met this name earlier in the history 
 of the most civilised race of the Sudan ; but it was not founded 
 by them, and had never before been counted among their pos- 
 sessions. So complete was the annexation of this famous city 
 that it obtained its supreme grandeur at the precise moment of 
 the Songhois 1 pre-eminence and declined with their fall. 
 
 Jenne, having emancipated itself at the time the Mali and 
 the Mossi were signalising their victories over the last of the 
 Dias, was reduced to obedience after a long siege. Sunni Ali 
 followed up the conquest by attacking the kingdoms of the 
 Mossi and the Hombouri in the centre of the valley, and the 
 Teska Kouboura and Kanta in the east. His chief and most 
 prolonged effort, however, was directed to the west, and con- 
 centrated upon the destruction of that Mali empire which had 
 threatened his nation in former days. He subdued nearly the 
 whole of the left bank of the western Niger in this manner, 
 taking little Haoussa (south of Timbuctoo) and Barra (country 
 of Gundam at Lake Debo); destroying Guiddio, a large town 
 on Lake Debo, and fighting against the Senhadiata, the Foulbes, 
 
THE SONGHOIS 103 
 
 and the people of Diarka. Returning to Gao from one of these 
 expeditions, he was drowned in a small tributary of the Niger to 
 the south of Timbuctoo. 
 
 ' He only suffered two reverses," relates the chronicle, ' one at 
 Duoneo (Douentza?) and the other in Barkou (Bourgoo). He 
 surpassed all the kings, his predecessors, in the numbers and valour 
 of his soldiery. His conquests were many, and his renown 
 extended from the rising to the setting of the sun. If it is 
 the will of God, he will be long spoken of. 1 The Sudanese 
 writers do, in fact, speak much of Ali the Conqueror, but it is 
 in an unexpected fashion. They heap the most violent epithets 
 upon him and cover him with insults. 'An impious monarch 
 and horrible tyrant, 1 says one. ' A great oppressor and destroyer 
 of towns, with a hard and unjust heart, 1 says another. ' A 
 sanguinary despot who slaughtered so many thousands of people 
 that God alone knows their number ; he was cruel to the pious 
 and wise, he humiliated them and put them to death, 1 exclaims 
 a third. 
 
 As a matter of fact, he was neither better nor worse than his 
 successors, nor any other Sudanese prince. War has always a 
 particularly brutal and detestable aspect in negro countries. The 
 impartiality of history has no concern with these accumulations of 
 abuse ; they merely represent the personal venom of his chroniclers. 
 These were the marabuts who represented literature and the 
 sciences, and were the vicegerents of Islam ; it was this latter 
 capacity that dictated their judgments. The incident is interest- 
 ing for its revelation of the bitter and revengeful feelings which 
 at this period actuated the Mohammedaa religion towards outside 
 affairs, even those of the past. It had not attained to great 
 power at this time, and its roots were by no means established 
 in the country. Later on, having acquired a stronger growth, 
 
-V 
 
 104 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 we shall find it still pursuing this role and becoming the prime 
 factor in considerable and calamitous events. The great griev- 
 ance cherished against the conqueror by the marabuts was his 
 very lukewarm religiousness. 6 He took great liberties with the 
 faith,"* relates the Tarik. ' He was wont to delay until nightfall 
 or even till next morning the five prayers which every good 
 Mussulman should say between the rising and the setting of the 
 sun. By degrees he contented himself with merely mentioning 
 their names, and finally he still further simplified these negligences 
 into a single invocation of the name of God, adding, " You all 
 know my prayers, let each take therefrom what concerns him.""' 
 
 The origin of this scepticism is explained in a little work by 
 El Mouchali, a very learned man of Tlemcen, of whom I shall 
 have occasion to speak later on. He affords us a glimpse of the 
 customs of the period, and shows us the position of Islamism in 
 this country towards the close of the fifteenth century. The 
 higher classes alone, it appears, had rallied to the religion of 
 Mahomet, and that without any great conviction. Idolatry was 
 not prohibited in the court itself, and, seeing that the monarch 
 showed himself scarcely a Mohammedan even in name, his retinue 
 would naturally follow his example. The people openly continued 
 to practise witchcraft and the worship of fetiches, whose temples 
 remained standing even in Gao and Jenne. 
 
 ' God had directed us, 1 says another extract, 4 towards a country 
 whose inhabitants called themselves Mussulmans, and who were so 
 on the surface. They attended the great service of Friday and 
 the week-day call to the five prayers, but we had little confidence 
 in their marabuts. . . . The manners of this country are very 
 singular. We find a people here who pretend to know the science 
 of occult things, and base this knowledge upon a study of lines 
 traced upon the sand, on the position of the stars, the cries of 
 
r j< 
 
106 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 birds and their flight, etc. They profess to write charms which will 
 increase profits, excite love, and oppose ruin ; which will put their 
 enemies to flight in battle and preserve themselves from the sword 
 and the poison of arrows : and many other things that sorcerers 
 practise in incantations. 
 
 ' The mother of Sunni Ali came from the country of Farou 
 (Sokato), a nation of infidels who adored images of wood and 
 stone. They had faith in these idols and consulted them. When 
 good or evil befell them, they ascribed it to the idols being 
 favourable or unfavourable. The worship of these false gods is 
 directed by priests, who are guided in their turn by soothsayers 
 and magicians who give consultations. 
 
 ' Sunni Ali passed his youth and grew to manhood there, and 
 his mind was naturally influenced by these idolatries and customs. 
 Nevertheless, he decided in favour of Mohammedanism when he 
 became king, although its usages were barely known to him. He 
 would add after the name of the Prophet, Let him be praised : 
 and after the holy name of Allah he would say, May the 
 prayer and salvation of God be with him. But the reverse is 
 what he should have said. For a time he fasted during the 
 month of Ramadan, and made offerings and sacrifices in the 
 mosques ; but after a while he returned to idols and soothsayers, 
 he sought guidance in practices of witchcraft, and honoured trees 
 and stones with sacrifices and offerings, asking of them the fulfil- 
 ment of his desires. 
 
 'At last, neither he nor his companions were ever seen (even on 
 Friday) in the cathedral mosque, or in any of the others, and from 
 fear of him the thousands of men and women dwelling in his house 
 neither fasted nor prayed during Ramadan. He did not know the 
 Fatiha (the first sura) by heart, nor any other sura of the Koran. 
 Habitually careless in his prayers, he neither bowed nor pro- 
 
THE SONGHOIS 107 
 
 strated himself during their recitation. He had relations with 
 women that are unrecognised by marriage, or any other contract 
 permitted by Islamism. If a woman pleased him he took her to 
 his palace regardless of her husband or her family. He also 
 allowed Mussulmans to be pillaged and slain, and he put to death 
 many theologians and learned men of law." 
 
 The last clause is true, but Mouchali omits to add that Sunni 
 Ali only ill-treated certain marabuts, and those, not because they 
 were Mussulmans and priests, but because they had interfered in 
 politics and conspired against him on account of his scepticism. 
 In spite of his enemies among the caste, he invariably honoured 
 the holy men who made religion and piety alone their study ; 
 'always keeping an accurate record of their numbers, 1 says the 
 Tarik, ' he paid homage to their merits and made them large 
 presents." 1 This generosity shows the tolerant spirit which is 
 characteristic of the Songhoi people. 
 
 I will only dwell upon one more side of his character, the 
 violence and frenzy of his wrath. It flamed into a fury upon 
 the least provocation, and in its transport he would order the 
 death of any one of his retinue, even of the one who was 
 useful and devoted to him and whom he most cherished. 
 The excess of his rage was only equalled by the promptness of 
 his remorse. His servants were aware of this, and, when the 
 condemned person was one whom Sunni Ali would afterwards 
 regret, they would merely keep him out of sight until the moment 
 of repentance arrived. The king would be filled with joy upon 
 these occasions to find that the fulfilment of his commands had 
 been delayed. 
 
 Among those whose existence was often separated from 
 Paradise by a mere thread was Mohammed ben Abou Bakr, 
 a native of Touroud. It is not easy to establish the exact 
 
108 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 number of times he was condemned to death, but he was Sunni's 
 right hand, his best general and his wisest minister. 'A great 
 heart, gifted with a great generosity which God had given him 
 by nature." 
 
 The death of Sunni Ali gave this man food for reflection. 
 
 
 A HOUSE IN JENNE 
 
 He naturally did not care to continue the same precarious 
 existence under the son, Sunni Barro, which he had enjoyed under 
 the father. His personal influence being considerable, he deter- 
 mined to seize the crown. 
 
 'As soon as his preparations were complete, therefore, he 
 placed himself at the head of his partisans and attacked Sunni 
 Barro at Dangha. His army was defeated and he was obliged 
 to take refuge in Gao. Reassembling his forces, however, the 
 adventurer tried his fortunes a second time. The struggle which 
 ensued was a long and desperate one, both armies being all but 
 annihilated, but Sunni Barro was finally obliged to fly from the 
 
THE SONGHOIS 109 
 
 country never to return to it, and Mohammed ben Abou Bakr 
 ascended the throne in 1494. 
 
 The news being announced to the daughters of Sunni Ali, 
 they exclaimed ' Askia ! ' which signifies ' It is not he,' or 
 4 Usurper. 1 This being repeated to him, Mohammed ordained 
 that no other surname should be given him, and Askia Mohammed 
 he accordingly became. 
 
 We have thus arrived at the third and last Songhoi dynasty, 
 which reigned from 1494 to 1591. 
 
 Askia Mohammed showed considerable political ability from 
 the very moment of his accession. He adopted an entirely new atti- 
 tude towards religion, and a few months after his accession there 
 was not a more devout Mussulman throughout all Songhois than 
 the late friend and companion of the 6 miserable infidel. 1 He 
 insisted that Islamism should be held in honour throughout the 
 country, and instead of the former soothsayers his retinue .now 
 consisted of marabuts. He showered gifts upon them and took 
 their advice in everything. 
 
 They, in return, hastened to legitimise his usurpation, autho- 
 rised him to take possession of the Conqueror's treasure, and assisted 
 him in despoiling the dignitaries of the former's rule. They 
 demonstrated in council that Sunni Ali had been the most 
 abominable of infidels, and, in consequence, the war undertaken 
 by Askia against his descendant was a necessary war, an excellent 
 war in short, a holy war. 
 
 The pious biographers exult over him, they represent him 
 as ' a brilliant light shining after great darkness ; a saviour 
 who drew the servants of God from idolatry and the country 
 from ruin. The Defender of the Faithful, who scattered joy, 
 gifts, and alms around him.' 
 
110 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 As soon as his authority was well established he placed 
 the reins of government in the hands of his brother Omar, and 
 proceeded to still further legitimise himself by a gorgeous pilgrim- 
 age to Mecca and Cairo (1497). 
 
 'He made a pilgrimage to the house of God, accompanied 
 by a thousand foot-soldiers and five hundred horse, and carrying 
 with him three hundred thousand mitkals of gold from the treasure 
 of Sunni Ali. He scattered this treasure in the holy places, at 
 the tomb of the Prophet in Medina, and at the sacred mosque at 
 Mecca. In the latter town he bought gardens and established a 
 charitable institute for the people of the Sudan. This place is 
 well known in Mecca, and cost five thousand mitkals. 
 
 ' He rendered homage to the Khalif Abassid Motewekkel in 
 Egypt, praying to be made his deputy in the Sudan in general 
 and in Songhois in particular. The Abassid consented, requiring 
 the king of Songhois to abdicate for three days and to place the 
 power in his hands. On the fourth day Motewekkel solemnly 
 proclaimed Askia Mohammed the representative of the sultan 
 in the Sudan. He accompanied this by placing a green fez 
 and white turban upon his head and returning him his sabre." 
 
 This pilgrimage had another and still more important effect 
 upon his reign and his people, for he assiduously entertained the 
 theologians and learned men of Cairo while there. He evinced 
 a great interest in many subjects, and displayed much anxiety to 
 receive their counsel upon the best and most enlightened manner 
 of life and government. He deferred especially to Essoyouti, 
 a scholar whose name is celebrated in Arabian literature to this 
 day. Askia opened a correspondence with him on his return to 
 Songhois, and always submitted his most important reforms to 
 the savant, never neglecting to follow his advice concerning them. 
 It was at Cairo, undoubtedly, that he acquired those notions of 
 
THE SONGHOIS 
 
 111 
 
 government which his organising genius applied to the erection 
 of a fabric so solid and durable that it lasted to the end of his 
 dynasty. Thus once again we find Egypt exercising a civilising 
 influence upon the Sudan. 
 
 Having won the sonorous title of ' Emir Askia el Hadj (the 
 pilgrim) Mohamman' by this long voyage, he earned, as the im- 
 mediate result of it, the more valuable title of Askia the Great. 
 He resumed the reins of government on his return, making his 
 brother Omar his generalissimo. The position of neither was 
 
 VIEW OF JENNE 
 
 an easy one, for Sunni All's unorganised conquests had to be 
 consolidated almost, in fact, renewed ; and hardly a year of his 
 reign is unmarked by some expedition. 
 
 The first was against the Mossi in 1449. This kingdom, 
 situated to the south of Songhois, had pursued a very turbulent 
 and aggressive policy, and advancing its boundaries throughout 
 the north of the valley (Gourma) had penetrated as far as 
 Oualata. The Tarik describes their suppression by Askia in the 
 following words : 
 
 'The Emir sent an ambassador to the king of Mossi demand- 
 ing his conversion to Islamism. The monarcli replied, saying he 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 must take counsel with his ancestors who were in the other world ; 
 and for this purpose he retired to the temple of his idols, accom- 
 panied by his court and the ambassador, the latter being curious 
 to see how the dead were communicated with. 
 
 'After the performance of the usual ceremonies of these 
 heathen, an old man appeared, before whom they prostrated 
 themselves, delivering the Emir's message. " I will never consent 
 to your doing this thing," was the reply. " You must fight against 
 the Songhois until you have exterminated either the enemy or 
 yourselves. 1 ' Then said the king to the ambassador, "Return 
 to your master and say to him that nothing but war can be 
 between him and me." When all the people had quitted the 
 temple, the ambassador spoke to the being who had appeared in 
 the form of an old man, and said, "In the name of the all- 
 powerful God, what art thou ? " "I am Satan," was the response, 
 " and I have led these people astray that they might perish in 
 their infidelity." The ambassador related all that had passed to 
 the Emir, and a holy war was declared. The arms of Askia were 
 victorious, and he destroyed their fields and villages, making men, 
 women, and children his prisoners, and compelling them to be 
 converted/ 
 
 After the south, the west ; and it now became necessary to 
 destroy the kingdom of the Mali, a twelve years 1 task (1501-1513). 
 Zalna, the capital, was taken, and so thoroughly destroyed that it 
 is now impossible to identify the situation of this once important 
 town. This success was followed up by a savage war upon the 
 provinces, the towns, and the races of the Mali. 
 
 The struggle was a desperate one on both sides, and the final 
 supremacy was dearly bought, as the following anecdote will show : 
 4 The Emir lost such great quantities of his best soldiers in Mali 
 that his brother Omar wept, saying, " The Songhois will be exter- 
 
THE SONGHOIS 
 
 113 
 
 minated." But Askia replied, " On the contrary, these conquered 
 nations will make our lives easier, for they will become a part of us, 
 and will assist us in our enterprises." And in this manner he 
 drove the sadness out of his brother's mind. 1 
 
 Having thus reduced the west, Askia turned his attention to 
 the east, and reorganised that portion of his empire lying in 
 the neighbourhood of Lake Chad (1514-1519). Agades had 
 asserted its independence at the instigation of the Berbers, and 
 he was obliged to reconquer it, as Sunni All had formerly sub- 
 dued Jenne. He also subjugated the kingdoms of Katfcina, Kano, 
 Zegzey, and Sanfara. 
 
 His empire now extended from the salt-mines of Thegazza in 
 
 THE SONGHOI ORGANISATION 
 
 the north to Bandouk, or the country of Bammaku, in the south, 
 and from Lake Chad in the east to the shores of the Atlantic 
 in the west. ' It was a six-months' journey to cross this for- 
 midable empire, 1 says a contemporary. 
 
 And yet the reign of Askia the Great is not so remarkable 
 
 i 
 
114 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 for its conquests as for the wise method of government he estab- 
 lished in the country, and the pains he took to closely incorporate 
 the new territories with the Songhoi empire. 
 
 Unlike Sunni Ali, he was not content with simply demanding 
 tribute, but destroyed all the old systems, and reconstructed 
 them, giving their administration into the hands of his own 
 functionaries. Thus the empire was not merely temporarily but 
 actually enlarged, and that for a prolonged period. It is 
 said that his will was as well carried out in the furthest 
 extremities' of his kingdom as in Songhois, or even in the royal 
 palace itself. 
 
 Four viceroys were created, who controlled the governors of 
 the provinces, military chiefs, judges, and the collection of taxes. 
 The first was the viceroyalty of Dandi (with a capital of the 
 same name), which commanded Lake Chad ; the second, that of 
 Bankou, governed the country between Timbuctoo and Gao in 
 the north ; the third was the viceroyalty of Bal or Balma, and 
 administered the whole of the north-west from Timbuctoo and 
 Gambara to Thegazza, and included the control of the king of 
 the Touaregs ; whilst the fourth and most important was that 
 of Kourmina (capital Tindirma) and comprised the government 
 of Baghena (Mali), Barra (capital Sa), Dirma (capital Dira), and 
 Massina. 
 
 The great governments of Bandouk, Kala (Sansanding), and 
 Hombouri had no viceroy. 
 
 The highest officers of state were either chosen from the 
 royal family or married to its princesses, as were the principal 
 military chiefs and marabuts. 
 
 The administration thus formed a dynastic aristocracy of the 
 greatest importance to national unity. 
 
 Another innovation, which assisted Askia to effect his numerous 
 
THE SONGHOIS 115 
 
 conquests and ensure the peace and prosperity of the country, 
 was the creation of a standing army. 
 
 Sunni AH had completely disorganised the Songhois by 
 pelling all the available population to prosecute his wars. Askia, 
 on the other hand, ' divided his people into subjects and soldiers.' 
 It was this trained soldiery that made the conquest of the impro- 
 vised and inexperienced bands of his enemies so easy. He formed 
 a large body of cavalry, armed with spears and mounted on 
 powerful horses brought from barbarous states. The bellicose 
 Touaregs were also formed into auxiliary squadrons. 
 
 The numerous infantry were armed with bows and poisoned 
 arrows; the great chiefs went to battle in cuirasses and iron 
 helmets, while the less important had shields only. When the 
 new territories had so greatly increased that the Songhois soldiers 
 no longer sufficed to maintain them, Askia recruited new troops 
 from the conquered populations, thus fulfilling the reassuring 
 prospects with which he had comforted Omar during the san- 
 guinary Mali campaign. 
 
 The division of the population into civil and military classes 
 permitted the productive and trading elements to pursue their 
 occupations undisturbed. Commerce developed amazingly, its 
 transactions being favoured and assisted by excellent measures 
 guaranteeing regularity and honesty. A unification of weights 
 and measures was decreed, and all falsifications were severely 
 punished, every market of importance being placed under the 
 surveillance of an inspector. Jenne was the centre of the internal 
 commerce, Timbuctoo monopolised relations with the west and 
 north-west (Morocco and Tuat principally), and Gao those with 
 the east and north-east (Egypt and Tripoli). 
 
 The Niger constituted the principal commercial route, for the 
 greater part of the transactions were carried on by water. Euro- 
 
116 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 pean merchandise penetrated in large quantities to the centre 
 of the black world, and were in such request, that the supply 
 scarcely kept pace with the demand. 
 
 In the train of the merchants came the learned strangers who 
 flocked to the Sudan upon hearing that they would be parti- 
 cularly well received. They came from Morocco, Tuat, Algeria, 
 and Cairo. Science and letters received a sudden impetus, and 
 were not long in producing Sudanese writers of the greatest 
 interest; whose manuscripts, in fact, furnish me with all these 
 details, and of whom I shall speak at greater length when we 
 have reached Timbuctoo. 
 
 Among his numerous innovations Askia naturally did not 
 neglect religion. It had, after himself, an official and supreme 
 representative (exclusively ecclesiastic) in the person of a Sheik- 
 ul-Islam, whose residence was at Timbuctoo. The king had seen 
 a similar authority side by side with the Khalif Abassid in 
 Egypt ; and he adopted this religious institution, together with 
 the attire and manner of living of the Arabian ruler. He formed 
 the etiquette of his court upon that of the Khalifs, keeping 
 himself strictly invisible to the vulgar eye. ' Askia el Hadj did 
 not care to be seen," reports the Tarik, ' and he persuaded his 
 brother Omar to follow his example in this. " Expose not thyself 
 to perish of the evil eye," he said to him/ He compelled the 
 women of the towns to lead the life of the Eastern harem, and 
 forbade that any (married or single) should show themselves 
 unveiled, making his own family set the example. People 
 approaching the king in audience covered their heads with dust : 
 he never spoke directly to assemblies nor to the people, but 
 always dealt with them through the medium of a herald. Upon 
 the occasions of his going out, his cortege was preceded by 
 musicians, drums, and trumpets, and he rode in solitary state, 
 
THE SONGHOIS 117 
 
 with his suite at a respectful distance behind. Servants 
 marched surrounding his horse, and holding by turns to his 
 saddle ; they were called foot companions, and their head-man 
 was the ' master of the road.' Viceroys had a right to a similar 
 but more modest display. Only one drum was allowed to precede 
 them, and their musicians were to keep silence when in sight of 
 a town in which the king was residing. In short, the royal 
 negro, like other white usurpers, made the greater parade of the 
 power and state of majesty the less right he had to it. But all 
 this is insignificant in view of the really great qualities possessed 
 by this ruler of the Songhois. 
 
 A wonderful impulse was imparted to this country in the six- 
 teenth century, and a marvellous civilisation appeared in the very 
 heart of the black continent. This civilisation was not imposed 
 by circumstances and force, as is so often the case, even in our own 
 countries, but was spontaneously desired, evoked, and propagated 
 by a man of the negro races. Unfortunately, its fairest promises 
 were never fulfilled, owing, not so much to the native successors, 
 as to the civilised (some say white) peoples who ruthlessly 
 destroyed all this good seed, and caused the tares of barbarism 
 to sprout anew. 
 
 After thirty-five years of responsibilities nobly discharged, the 
 faculties of Askia the Great began to decline. His numerous sons 
 (he had a hundred) now longed to be quit of him, and finally the 
 eldest, Askia Moussa, revolted and deposed his father at Gao, 1529. 
 
 All that Moussa and his successors were called upon to do was 
 to live in the solid edifice erected by the founder of their dynasty. 
 I will only relate, therefore, those particulars of their reigns which 
 will enable us to form some idea of the character, manners, and 
 customs of these people at this time. 
 
118 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 Melissa's first care was to moderate the ambition of his 
 brothers by having a certain number of them put to death. 
 Some offered armed resistance, notably Bala, his father's favourite 
 son. ' Being forced to give himself up, Bala replied to the 
 intercession of the king's son on his behalf, "My child, it is 
 necessary that I should die ; for these three things I would never 
 consent to do give Moussa the title of Askia, throw dust upon 
 my head in his presence, nor ride behind him in processions." 
 Moussa commanded an exceedingly deep hole to be dug, in which 
 Bala and one of his cousins were placed ; it was then filled with 
 water, and the two young men were drowned.' These singular 
 family manners furnished the restored and consolidated Islam with 
 an occasion to, very laudably and courageously, assert its authority. 
 The Sheik-ul-Islam interposed as mediator between Moussa and 
 his brothers, and vindicated his position in the following manner. 
 He took his place beside Moussa, turning his face away from him. 
 ' Dost thou dare to turn thy back upon me ? ' asked Moussa ; and 
 the Sheik replied, ' I cannot look upon the face of him that has 
 deposed the Emir of the true believers/ On another occasion 
 a mere marabut delivered himself of the following : ' We enjoyed 
 prosperity and repose in the. reign of thy father, the happy, the 
 good ; and we made prayers that God might accord him victory 
 and a long life. We asked ourselves, Has he a son who shall be 
 the hope of Islam ? and we answered, Yes ; so we offered prayers 
 for thee as well as for thy father. Thou hast deceived our hopes, 
 but we do not cease our prayers, only instead of invoking God in 
 thy favour we pray against thee.' 
 
 Finding themselves in the process of decimation, the brothers 
 of Moussa assassinated him, and a nephew of Askia the Great 
 reigned under the title of Askia Bankouri (1533). . He, also, made 
 haste to remove a certain number of his uncle's sons, and even 
 
THE SONGHOIS 
 
 119 
 
 showed an increased cruelty towards the great and unhappy old 
 man himself. Moussa had at least left Askia to live quietly in 
 the royal palace of Gao, but Bankouri relegated him to the little 
 island of Kankaka, to the west of that town, ' where the frogs 
 leaped around him,' says the chronicle. 
 
 Bankouri appears to have wielded the power with great 
 
 A CORNER IN JENNE 
 
 magnificence. His court was brilliant, for he liked to be sur- 
 rounded by all his dignitaries, who wore gorgeous garments. 
 Music was held in high esteem, and a chorus of singing slaves was 
 established. 
 
 He was deposed in 1537 by the viceroy of Dandi, whom he 
 had imprudently threatened, and Askia Ismael was proclaimed 
 king. The motives that decided the latter to accept the crown 
 were as varied as they were remarkable. 
 
 4 1 accepted the honour for three reasons, 1 he declared : ' to 
 
120 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 rescue my father from his distressful condition, to enable my 
 sisters to resume the veil that Bankouri had obliged them to 
 relinquish, and to pacify Yan Mara, one of the hundred hen 
 ostriches who was wont to throw herself into a frenzy whenever 
 she saw Bankouri. 1 
 
 The Tarik does not tell us if Yan Mara recovered her 
 happiness after this, but we learn with pleasure that Askia the 
 Great returned to his palace of Gao, and died in peace there in 
 1538. Ismael was the first of the Askia to die on his throne 
 (1540), and he was succeeded by his brother, Askia Ishak. He, 
 like his predecessors, had very strong family feelings, and put an 
 end to a good many of his relations. He is reported to have 
 destroyed one of them by means of a spell. ' Arbinda, his sister's 
 son, caused him much anxiety. He was a remarkable man, of such 
 astonishing valour, that he was greatly desired as a successor to 
 Ishak. The latter confided his fears to a man versed in the occult 
 sciences, and begged his assistance. The magician filled a vase 
 with water and pronounced several invocations, after which he 
 called ' Arbinda ! Arbinda ! come hither ! ' Then there rose out 
 of the water a puppet greatly resembling Arbinda, and the 
 magician put chains upon its feet and struck it with a spear, 
 saying, ' Go ! ' and the puppet disappeared. Soon afterwards it 
 was found that Arbinda had died at the moment the image was 
 struck by the magician. 
 
 The four last Askias to reign over the whole empire were 
 Askia Daoud, 1549-1581 ; Askia El Hadj n., 1581-1586; Askia 
 Mohamman Ban, 1586-1587; and Askia Ishak n., 1587-1591. 
 These, like their predecessors, undertook a certain number of 
 expeditions (almost all fortunate ones), not so much to make new 
 conquests as to preserve the old ones. They had no need to 
 enlarge their magnificent heritage, as we can well understand, but 
 
"HE 
 
 .DIVERSITY 
 
 OF 
 
 THE SONGHOIS 
 
 121 
 
 they did not even make an effort to improve it, nor to encourage 
 the progress instituted by the first of their race. If, on the one 
 hand, they were not guilty of any retrogressive movement, as 
 little can any wise innovation be attributed to them. 
 
 Fratricidal struggles, family ferocities, and a perpetual fear of 
 rivalry, were their dominant pre-occupations, always including 
 debauch. ' They changed the fear of God into infidelities. Aban- 
 doned to the practice of forbidden things, they covered themselves 
 with sin in the open day. They drank intoxicating liquids, and 
 committed acts contrary to nature. Adultery was their most 
 common vice ; it would seem that they did not even consider it 
 reprehensible, and neither rank nor services were any obstacle to 
 
 them. Some even committed this sin with their own sisters.' 
 
 In spite of receiving no care from its rulers, the powerful 
 
 machinery created and set in 
 
 motion by Askia the Great still 
 
 endured, so well had it been 
 
 planned and so solidly was it 
 
 built. For nearly a quarter of 
 
 a century its prosperity suffered 
 
 no decrease. The empire was so 
 
 firmly constructed that it would 
 
 have lasted intact until the race of 
 
 Askia had produced a sovereign 
 
 worthy of its founder and well 
 
 fitted to continue his work. 
 
 But now the invading Moor 
 
 appears, and the Songhoi empire 
 
 passes out of sight, to become a 
 
 Moorish colony, which is to say that the terrible Arabian race is 
 
 about to accomplish one of its worst pieces of work in the Sudan. 
 
CHAPTER VII 
 
 THE MOORS IN THE SUDAN 
 
 THE prosperity of the Sudan, and its wealth and commerce, were 
 known far and wide in the sixteenth century. Caravans returning 
 along the coasts proclaimed its splendours in their camel loads of 
 gold, ivory, hides, musk, and the spoils of the ostrich. The 
 Portuguese (always the first traders of Europe), endeavoured at this 
 time to enter into relations with these countries of the Niger, 
 whose magnificence had become a proverb. c As tar cures the gall 
 of a camel, so poverty finds its unfailing remedy in the Sudan,' 
 was the saying of northern Africa. 
 
 So many attractions gathered together under one sky could 
 not fail to rouse the attention, and by-and-by the cupidity, of 
 neighbouring territories. Chief among these was naturally that 
 country nearest to the Sudan, Morocco. From the first their 
 avarice assumed a harshly definite character, for the people of 
 Morocco had not, and never did have, any desire to colonise and 
 develop a commerce, nor even to institute a religious propaganda. 
 They looked upon the Sudan in the light of a gold-mine, and 
 their first aspirations, like their ultimate efforts, were concentrated 
 upon the mere drainage of this precious metal. This covetousness 
 of theirs was also the source of a new danger to the Sudan, as it 
 became the means of jeopardising its salt-supply. 
 
 The interior of the Sudan lacks this most necessary of 
 
 122 
 
THE MOORS IN THE SUDAN 
 
 products, and salt represented, and always will represent, their 
 principal article of commerce. It was the true gold of the 
 Sudanese, their most precious commodity, and they obtained it 
 from the mines of Thegazza, which were situated in the heart of 
 the desert. These mines were nearer to Morocco than to the 
 countries of the Niger, but Thegazza, as we have seen, was 
 the property of the Songhois, and possessed its representative 
 Emir. 
 
 Hostilities commenced towards the middle of the sixteenth 
 century. In 1545 Mouley Mohammed El Kebir, the sultan of 
 Morocco, sent an embassy to the king of the Songhois, claiming 
 the mines of Thegazza, under the pretext that they were situated 
 on his frontiers. Askia Ishak i. admitted neither the pretext nor 
 the argument, and emphasised his denial of the claim by an army 
 of Touaregs whom he despatched to pillage Draa, a town on 
 the frontiers of Morocco, a plain intimation that he was strong 
 enough to defend his own, and was quite prepared to do so should 
 the sultan be inclined to dispute his rights. 
 
 This firm attitude gained a twenty-years respite for' the 
 Sudan, and the question was not reopened until a later reign. 
 It then assumed a new form under Mouley Abdallah, who, instead 
 of claiming Thegazza itself, demanded a rent for the use of the 
 mines. The Sudan was under the rule at this time of Askia 
 Daoud, who did not entertain the question of tribute, but sent a 
 very conciliatory message to the sultan, accompanied by a present 
 of ten thousand mitkals of gold (150,000 francs). The sultan 
 was so overcome by the magnificence of this gift that he made 
 no further demands (1547). 
 
 The fatal moment approached, however, with the accession of 
 the Sultan El Mansour. A reform, of great importance under 
 the circumstances, had been instituted by his predecessor, who 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 had greatly increased the efficiency of the army by supplying it 
 with firearms, cannon, etc. 
 
 From the beginning of his reign El Mansour had especially 
 occupied himself with the Sudan. He sent an embassy in 1583, 
 ostensibly chargeol with magnificent gifts, but in reality com- 
 missioned to reconnoitre the roads and principal towns of Songhois, 
 and make a study of its army. Askia El Hadj n. received the 
 embassy at Gao, and returned it laden with gifts of still greater 
 splendour than those it had brought. This was fuel to the flames, 
 and, too impatient to waste any time in making preparations, El 
 Mansour set twenty thousand men on the road to Timbuctoo. 
 The route, traversing desert after desert, was a long one, and in 
 no way fitted to accommodate an unexpected army. Hunger and 
 thirst very soon forced the invaders to retreat, and the sultan had 
 to content himself with posting a body of two hundred musketeers 
 at Thegazza. Thereupon the Sudanese abandoned the place and 
 its mines for others recently discovered at Taoudenni, which 
 for the future supplied them with the precious produce. 
 
 El Mansour now had more salt than he knew what to do 
 with, but no gold, and the Sudan continued to occupy his 
 thoughts. A new king reigning in Songhois, he resuscitated the 
 ancient pretext of tribute, and demanded a mitkal of gold for 
 every load of salt entering the Sudan. Askia Ishak n. refused 
 point blank, and, by way of expressing his whole thought, accom- 
 panied the refusal by a gift of swords and javelins. He should 
 have gone still further, and followed the example of Ishak i. by 
 sending a force of Touaregs to show themselves upon the Moorish 
 frontier. As it was. El Mansour took the initiative. 
 
 Having convoked a grand council of his most experienced 
 advisers at Marrakesh, he explained his plans to them in the 
 following words : ' I have resolved to attack the Sudan. It 
 
THE MOORS IN THE SUDAN 125 
 
 is an exceedingly rich country, and will furnish us with large 
 taxes, and we shall thus be enabled to give greater importance 
 to the Mohammedan armies.' 
 
 The sultan having thus, as a contemporary Moorish historian 
 expresses it, ' emptied his quiver and purged his liver of its bile, 1 
 did not find his assembly particularly enthusiastic upon the 
 subject. ' Prince, 1 they said, 4 there is an immense desert between 
 our country and the Sudan, which is devoid of water and vege- 
 tation, and so hard to traverse that the very birds lose their 
 way there. 1 ' If these are all your objections, 1 replied El Mansour, 
 6 1 see no reason why they should hinder my resolution. You 
 speak of dangerous deserts and perilous solitudes. But do we 
 not see, from day to day, feeble merchants, poor in resource, 
 penetrating these regions, and passing through them on foot, on 
 horse or camel, in groups or solitary ? Cannot I do what these 
 caravans accomplish ? I, who am in every way better equipped 
 than they ? The conquest itself will be an easy one, for these 
 Sudanese know neither powder nor cannon, nor are they 
 acquainted with the muskets of terrifying sound. They are 
 only armed with spears and sabres, and what can they avail 
 against us ? Why should we make war against the Turk, who 
 gives much trouble and little profit, when the Sudan would 
 be an easy conquest, and is richer than the whole of northern 
 Africa? 1 The councillors allowed themselves to be persuaded 
 by this eloquence, saying, ' Lord, God has inspired you with the 
 truth, and we have no longer anything to say against it. So true 
 is it that the minds of princes are the princes of minds. 1 
 
 El Mansour took immense pains to organise an army, not 
 great in numbers, but carefully selected. From among his nomadic 
 soldiers and auxiliaries he chose the bravest and most devoted 
 men, providing them with strong camels and thoroughbred horses. 
 
126 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 In this manner he collected an army of three thousand musketeers 
 and a thousand combatants (half cavalry and half foot) with 
 side-arms. The supreme command was intrusted to the Pasha 
 Djonder, with ten subordinate chiefs (or kaids), and the expedition 
 left Morocco towards the end of the year 1590. 
 
 It entered the Sudan from the west, near the region of the 
 lakes south of Timbuctoo, and its fortunate arrival on the banks 
 of the Niger was considered in the light of its first victory, and 
 was celebrated by a great festival of rejoicing. It now turned 
 towards Gao, the capital, and when Ishak n. heard of the arrival 
 of the Moors he assembled an army of thirty thousand foot and 
 twelve thousand horse, and opposed them to the invaders. The 
 battle took place in February 1591 at Toundibi, not far from 
 Timbuctoo. 
 
 El Mansour had not made a wrong estimate of the perfections 
 of his armament. The Songhois were routed almost without a 
 blow being struck, 'in the twinkling of an eye, 1 it is said. The 
 sudden shock of smoke, noise, and the hail of balls so terrified 
 them, that many, thinking nothing could preserve them from such 
 miracles, did not even attempt to fly. They were found upon 
 their shields with legs crossed, waiting for the conquerors, and 
 they allowed themselves to be killed without making any move- 
 ment in self-defence. The Moors pitilessly slew the demoralised 
 crowd, not even sparing those who cried, ' We are Mussulmans ; 
 we are your brothers in religion. 1 
 
 The panic lasted as it had reigned during the battle, and 
 spread throughout the entire country. Ishak, who had gone to 
 battle full of confidence, surrounded by magicians and sorcerers, 
 took to his heels at the beginning of the action, and made no 
 attempt to resist, even in the capital itself. On receiving a com- 
 mand to evacuate it the monarch sought refuge with the crowd, 
 
THE MOORS IN THE SUDAN 127 
 
 flying to Bornou in the south-east, without attempting the chance 
 of a second battle. 
 
 Djonder entered Gao without striking a blow, and Ishak 
 hastened to make overtures of peace, acquiescing in the demand 
 of annual tribute, and offering a present of a hundred thousand 
 mitkals of gold, and one hundred slaves in addition. 
 
 The pasha, judging these terms acceptable, transmitted them 
 to the sultan with a convoy of gold and slaves, and then turned 
 his steps to Timbuctoo, taking it without opposition, and settling 
 there to await the reply of his master. 
 
 El Mansour, however, would not hear of limiting himself to 
 his original claims. The success which he had so clearly foreseen 
 intoxicated him. ' He received so much gold-dust, musk, slaves, 
 ebony, and other valuable objects, 1 says the chronicle, ' that the 
 envious are troubled and all spectators are stupefied. He now 
 pays his functionaries in pure metal of good weight/ From which 
 it would appear that he had not been above falsifying his coinage. 
 ' There were fourteen thousand smiths in his palace employed in 
 making the gold into coins, while other portions of the treasure 
 were converted into necklaces and jewels, and the name of El 
 Dekebi (the Golden) was given to the sultan/ 
 
 Great public rejoicings continued at Marrakesh during three 
 days, and deputations came from all parts to offer congratulations. 
 Poets wrote verses to celebrate El Mansour's glory, inviting ' the 
 birds of happiness to sing unceasingly in his honour, 1 and calling 
 him ' the root of glory to which all attach themselves/ The 
 triumph of the white over the negro race was recorded in the 
 following picturesque language: 'The army of the day hath 
 fallen upon the army of night, and the whiteness of the one hath 
 destroyed the blackness of the other/ 
 
 It was not without reason that the Moors exulted over the 
 
J 
 
 128 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 conquest. ' They found that the Sudan, 1 says the Tarik^ ' rivalled 
 the countries most favoured by God, in the abundance, prosperity, 
 security, and health of all its territories, and all these benefits 
 resulted from the blessed reign of the Emir of the true believers, 
 Askia El Hadj. But from this time everything was altered; 
 security became fear, prosperity was changed into ruin, health 
 into sickness and anguish, and men began to fight and pillage 
 among themselves. 
 
 Dissatisfied with the moderation of Djonder, El Mansour 
 removed him from the supreme command and instantly despatched 
 another pasha, named Mahmoud, to the south. He was instructed 
 to pursue Askia Ishak to the death, and make the Sudan a 
 Moorish province. On reaching Timbuctoo, Mahmoud garrisoned 
 it and departed with the army in search of the king of the Songhois. 
 The latter, hearing that his terms were rejected by the sultan, 
 took up arms afresh ; but the disaster of Bamba was as complete 
 as that of the first encounter, and Ishak was forced to retreat 
 further into the south. 
 
 In these circumstances (already sufficiently critical), the Song- 
 hois enfeebled themselves still further by internal dissensions. Half 
 the army proclaimed Askia Kaghou king, and Askia Ishak was too 
 demoralised to make any effort to regain the supremacy. He dis- 
 appeared from the scene in a manner that, if not heroic, was at least 
 tragic. ' Having resolved to yield the power to his rival, he gathered 
 together the officers of that part of the army which had remained 
 faithful to him, and collecting all the insignia of royalty, they 
 burned them in a place called Tera. The king and his officers then 
 took leave of one another, weeping and begging mutual forgiveness; 
 and this was the last time they saw each other.' Ishak shortly 
 afterwards died, obscure and abandoned, at Gourma (1592). 
 
THE MOORS IN THE SUDAN 129 
 
 The pasha now proceeded to a conquest and pacification which 
 have become legendary. The usurper, Askia Kaghou, having given 
 himself up, he and his retinue were crushed (by order of the pasha), 
 by the fall of the house in which they were imprisoned. Eighty- 
 three members of the royal house suffered death in various ways, 
 some being beheaded, while others were drowned or crucified. 
 
 Timbuctoo, which had rebelled against the harsh treatment 
 of the garrison, was cruelly punished. Two of its chief personages 
 were mutilated by having their hands and feet cut off, and were 
 then left to die. Many were massacred, and all the learned men, 
 those marabuts who had been the pride of the great city, were 
 imprisoned or taken to Morocco, from whence very few returned. 
 
 With the fall of the Songhois many of their conquered pro- 
 vinces revolted, pillaging and destroying in the south and east of 
 the empire. Half the kingdom fell a prey to anarchy. Foulbes, 
 Touaregs and Bambarras distinguished themselves in this capacity. 
 Moorish columns, aided by the kaids, overran Baghena, Diarka, 
 Jenne, and the countries of the Upper Niger, ravaging as they 
 went. 
 
 At the same time, the pasha Mahmoud was similarly occupied 
 in the other extremity of the kingdom, in Houmbouri and Dandi, 
 where a few Songhois had taken refuge with Askia Noe. 
 
 In 1595 the conquest was complete, and the Moors, realising 
 that the Niger was the key to the Sudan, fortified its course from 
 east to west, garrisoning Jenne, Tindirma, Timbuctoo, Bamba, 
 Gao, and Koulani in the extreme south-east. Each of these forts 
 was placed under the command of a kaid. 
 
 The governor of the colony took the title of pasha. He was 
 nominated by the sultan, sent from Morocco, and exercised the civil 
 power only. The chief command of the troops devolved upon a 
 kaid, and there was also a hakim, or kahia, who filled the offices 
 
 K 
 
130 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 of treasurer and prime minister. The sultan further instituted 
 two emirs, who were comptrollers for the crown, and resided, the 
 one at Timbuctoo, and the other at Jenne. These two towns, 
 with Gao, were the great centres of occupation, Jenne and Gao 
 finally ceding the position of capital to Timbuctoo. The latter 
 town, situated on the high-road to Morocco, was the residence of 
 the governor ; the greater part of the troops were quartered in 
 it, while reinforcements arrived at and expeditions started from 
 there. 
 
 This represents the Moorish side of the colony, but it still 
 preserved a native one. Mahmoud, after establishing the pres- 
 tige of the conquerors by the cruelties we have just witnessed, 
 soon realised that the administration of the country would be 
 impossible if he destroyed the whole of its organisation. Some 
 members of the royal family had joined him since the invasion, and 
 he distinguished one among them, Askia Soleiman, by making 
 him king under his tutelage, and giving him a residence at Tim- 
 buctoo. Askia the Great's distribution of the country into vice- 
 royalties and governments was preserved, the pasha retaining the 
 nomination to these posts. Touaregs, Foulbes, Songhois, and 
 feudatories were recruited to form auxiliary troops, and when the 
 musketeers departed on an expedition they were accompanied by 
 native contingents, commanded by their king, or viceroy, under 
 the orders of the kaid. 
 
 For twenty years the constitution worked pretty well ; then, in 
 consequence of events that occurred at Morocco, disintegration set 
 in. El Mansour died from poisoning in 1604. His successors, 
 occupied with palace intrigues and intestinal struggles, took no 
 further heed of the Sudan than to look for its convoys of gold, 
 and interested themselves little, if at all, in what went on there. 
 In 1613 the governor of the Sudan was no longer nominated 
 
THE MOORS IN THE SUDAN 131 
 
 from Morocco, but was chosen by the troops from among their 
 kaids. Up to now the soldiers had been periodically reinforced. 
 In 1605 twenty-three thousand Moors had been sent to the Niger, 
 but these supplies gradually dwindled, and ceased altogether in 
 1620. The sultan only manifested his care and attention when 
 some embezzlement was brought to his notice, or when the trans- 
 ports of gold did not equal his expectations; and on these 
 occasions he would give orders to hang and drown a certain 
 number of persons interested. For the rest, he left the colony to 
 disentangle its affairs as it best could, which it occasionally accom- 
 plished by tying them into tighter knots than before. The kaids 
 deposed one another and disputed the title of pasha among them- 
 selves, settling their rivalries by force of arms. The pasha of 
 to-day beheaded or imprisoned the pasha of yesterday. In a 
 period of thirty years, 1620 to 1650, twenty governors may be 
 counted. Some enjoyed the power for a mere six or eight months, 
 and later on their reigns are to be counted by weeks and days, 
 some by a day only, and occasionally there was no pasha at all. 
 In spite of the disputes concerning this ephemeral and generally 
 tragic dignity, its prestige as a position was still enforced among 
 the natives, and any revolt always found the Moors united 
 against it. 
 
 It was not long, however, before this solidarity was shaken. 
 The garrisons mutinied, and offered battle to the troops of the 
 pasha; rivalries spread among the soldiers, as they had among their 
 chiefs. They divided into parties, of Fez, Marrakesh, and, in the 
 the south, Moors. These different elements were not existing on 
 their arrival in the Sudan, but had grown up in the various 
 garrisons and the jealousies that arose among them. Little by 
 little they gained independence and formed small governments, 
 ruling the neighbouring countries. The governor of Timbuctoo 
 

 A STREET IN JENNE 
 
THE MOORS IN THE SUDAN 133 
 
 retained the title of pasha, but it became a purely nominal one, 
 and his authority was only recognised in his own region. The 
 single remaining tie between the colony and Morocco was the 
 tribute to the sultan, and that was paid as irregularly as 
 possible. 
 
 In the eighteenth century the independence of the Sudan was 
 complete ; the name ' Moor ' had even ceased to distinguish the 
 masters of the country. The former conquerors had intermarried 
 with the Songhois, and had increased and multiplied abundantly, 
 their descendants being called Roumas, after El Mansour^s 
 musketeers, who had made such a terrible impression on their 
 first appearance in the Sudan. The native organisation, Askia's 
 viceroys and koi's, had disappeared, and many territories had 
 asserted their independence under the government of local chiefs. 
 The Roumas retained principally those banks of the Niger on 
 which their forefathers had settled. Each group only concerned 
 itself with its own region, and had no relations, beyond occasion- 
 ally hostile ones, with neighbouring groups. Profiting by all this, 
 two elements of confusion established themselves and augmented 
 the general anarchy, viz. the Touaregs and the Foulbes. 
 
 The Touaregs were the first to exploit the situation. They 
 crossed the river, exchanging their position in the sands of the 
 Sahara for the opulent plains in the north of the valley. In 
 1770 they had taken Gao from the Roumas, and Timbuctoo in 
 1800. The constant rivalries of their distinct tribal 'divisions 
 delayed the organisation of their conquests. It was not so, how- 
 ever, with the Foulbes. 
 
 Contrary to the opinion that obtains among the Europeans of 
 the Sudan and Senegal, and is accepted to this day by the 
 numerous books of travel, the Foulbes did not enter the Sudan 
 
134 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 from the east. Neither did they come by the valley of the Nile, 
 as some, identifying them with the Fellahs, believe : there is no 
 connection between them. It was from the west, from the Adrar, 
 the land of sand extending to the north of Senegal, that they 
 arrived. The Tarik clearly says, ' The Foulbes are nations of the 
 land of Tischitt." They are connected with the white race, as 
 are the Touaregs, and like them are pastoral nomads. 
 
 The Foulbes were probably forced back towards the Sudan 
 when the Moors, driven out from Spain, invaded Adrar. This 
 exodus towards the east was not an emigration, nor an invasion, 
 nor a conquest. It was for these shepherds and their flocks a 
 mere changing of pasture. A great number of them settled 
 amid the fertility of Massina, and it is there that we see a power- 
 fully organised empire arise in 1813. 
 
 Cheikou Ahmadou, its founder, not only ousted the Roumas, 
 
 JENNE 
 
 but made war upon the Touaregs and captured Timbuctoo from 
 them, accomplishing all this in the space of twenty years. 
 
THE MOORS IN THE SUDAN 135 
 
 He had been a petty chief reigning in the country of 
 Noukouna (Massina) under the name of Ahmadou Lobo. He 
 spread about the report that he was of the family of the Prophet, 
 one of his ancestors having married a daughter of Mahomet ; and 
 he was, like all the Foulbes, a fanatically zealous Mussulman. In 
 Africa, in the countries of the Niger and the Nile, fanaticism can 
 be carried to all lengths, and his zeal was, in fact, the origin of 
 his fortunes. His history is sufficiently curious ; for us, practical 
 masters of the Sudan, it is full of instruction. 
 
 An Arabian work, found at Timbuctoo, revealed his history 
 to me. It was a little pamphlet of propaganda, written and 
 disseminated by an influential marabut at the instigation of 
 Cheikou Ahmadou. The author pompously addresses himself to 
 the whole of Africa ; ' to the sultans of Morocco, Tunis, and 
 Algiers, to the Andalusians ' (a Moorish tribe which had sought 
 shelter in western Africa after their expulsion from Spain), 6 to 
 the populations living near the great salt sea (Atlantic), and to 
 all people who are followers of Islam. 
 
 4 The twelfth of the regenerating Khalifs, he after whom the 
 Mahdi comes, is born. He is the Sheik, the Emir of the Faithful, 
 Ahmadou ben Mohammed, who is risen to restore the faith of 
 the Lord and to do battle for God in the Sudan/ 
 
 After this, it is necessary to prove that our friend is the 
 twelfth Khalif. 4 If I am asked for the proof of this,' says the 
 devout marabut, ' I reply, the proof is to be found in the Fatassi, 
 a history of our country written by that learned man of law, 
 Mahmoud Koutou (or Koti)/ 
 
 The author, under the pretence of quotation, now proceeds to 
 very neatly relate his client to all the most celebrated Songhoi 
 princes, and even to Askia the Great. He thus serves a double 
 purpose, shedding upon the unknown the prestige of a popular 
 
136 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 sovereign's glory, and securing the sympathy, if not the con- 
 currence, of the Songhois populations. He dilates at great length 
 upon the renown, goodness, and wisdom of the great Askia, 
 details his pilgrimage to Mecca, announcing that he became 
 Khalif, but adding that he was only the eleventh of those Khalifs 
 whose coming had been foretold by Mahomet. 
 
 So far he is accurate enough and fairly approximates to history, 
 but after this we enter the region of fable, the mythical facts of 
 interested trickery. After recalling the fact that Askia conversed 
 with and became the friend of Essoyouti at Cairo, the author of 
 the pamphlet makes the famous sheik deliver himself of the 
 following prophecy. ' After thee,' he announced to the king of 
 the Songhois, ' the Sudan shall behold a twelfth Khalif, who will 
 not be of thy family, Askia. A holy man shall arise, a priest shall 
 he be and learned, an active man and an observer of the law, and 
 he shall be called Ahmadou ben Mohammed, of the tribe of the 
 Ulemas of Sonkor, and shall manifest himself in the island of Sibre- 
 Massina. He shall inherit the Khalifat from thee, and shall have 
 abundance of smiles, moral beauty, and victory, and he shall be 
 established in all his designs. Thy greatness shall be surpassed by 
 his, for he will have studied the sciences, while thou knowest only 
 justice, prayer, and the elements of the faith. Such shall be the 
 twelfth Khalif announced by Mahomet." 
 
 No one but Askia would have persisted in the face of such very 
 unpleasant predictions, but (according to the pamphlet) the great 
 king desires to know more concerning the successor who is to have 
 no connection with his family but is to surpass him in glory. 
 
 6 Will this new Khalif find the faith prospering ? ' he asks. 
 ' No, 1 the oracular sheik replies. ' He will find religion destroyed, 
 but Ahmadou shall be as a spark among dry grass. God shall 
 give him the victory over infidels, and will prosper all who aid him. 
 
THE MOORS IN THE SUDAN 137 
 
 Those who see this Khalif and follow him shall be blessed as were 
 the followers of Mahomet, and all who render obedience unto 
 him shall be as those who obeyed the Prophet. 
 
 It can scarcely be necessary to explain that this prophecy is 
 not to be found in the Fatassi, but was invented to assist the 
 cause of Cheikou Ahmadou and the Foulbes. It is as well, 
 however, to bring the document to light, as it was probably in the 
 same manner that the Mahdi of the Egyptian Sudan was accre- 
 dited fourteen years ago. It was thus we recently saw El Hadj 
 Omar and Samory rise, and it will undoubtedly be in the cause of 
 religious fanaticism that the country will be roused to revolt 
 against our dominion in the future. 
 
 Our Sudanese possessions are peopled with divers races 
 owning so little in common with one another, that it would always 
 be possible to bring one tribe to reason with the assistance of 
 another, on the condition that the religious influence, which alone 
 could subdue the jealousies and dissensions of these different 
 nations and unite them in a dangerous whole, must be at once 
 and totally crushed. 
 
 Cheikou Ahmadou died in 1844, and was succeeded by his son 
 Ahmadou Cheikou. Even during the lifetime of its founder this 
 hastily constructed empire had shown signs of failing, for the 
 Foulbes, rapacious and cruel to co-religionists and infidels alike, 
 were kept constantly defending their supremacy. So great was 
 their unpopularity that the inhabitants of Timbuctoo did not 
 hesitate to call a third element to their assistance, and introduced 
 the Berber tribe of Kountas from the south of Tunis into the 
 valley of the Niger. 
 
 In addition to this, a rival dynasty was already dawning in the 
 regions of the Upper Niger and Senegal. It was founded by a 
 
_7 
 
 138 T I M B U C T O O 
 
 member of the Toucouleurs, a tribe of negro and Foulbe half- 
 breeds. Of insignificant origin, the son of a marabut, he too traded 
 on a reputation for holiness. He made a pilgrimage to Mecca, 
 and called himself El Hadj Omar. Like Cheikou Ahmadou, he 
 put the whole of the southern Sudan to fire and sword under the 
 pretext of a divine mission against the infidels ' the infidels' being 
 all those who were unwilling to submit to his authority. Having 
 pillaged and destroyed the south, he turned to the north and 
 west, to attack the Foulbe empire and their new king, Ahmadou 
 Ahmadou. A great battle took place at Sofara, which resulted 
 in a victory to El Hadj Omar, and decided the supremacy of the 
 valley of the Niger. Sorely wounded, Ahmadou Ahmadou, with 
 a few faithful spirits, took flight in canoes, hoping to reach 
 Timbuctoo. 
 
 Learning the direction taken by the fugitives, the king of the 
 Toucouleurs commanded him to be pursued and taken alive. The 
 wounded man would have offered some resistance on being over- 
 taken, but the last of the faithful fled across the fields leaving 
 Ahmadou alone, face to face with El Hadj Omar's people. On 
 hearing the order that had been given to them, Ahmadou Ahmadou 
 replied, ' I will not return to Omar. I will never see him in this 
 world again. 1 He returned to the canoe, and taking his valuables 
 from it he placed them upon the ground. Putting on a white 
 garment he knelt and made salaam, then, having finished his 
 prayer, he turned to the Toucouleurs and said, ' I will never be 
 Omar's prisoner. Fulfil now my last request, and do that which 
 is pleasing to God. Kill me, and all these things will I give to 
 you in recompence, and you shall say to Omar he died of his 
 wounds.' 
 
 Thus was the tale of the death of the last king of the Foulbes 
 told me at Jenne. El Hadj Omar vowed undying hatred against 
 
THE MOORS IN THE SUDAN 
 
 139 
 
 Ahmadou's family and slew eight of its members, two of Ahmadou's 
 nephews alone succeeding in saving themselves. One of these 
 two, Ahmadou Abdoulay, retreating to the east of the valley, 
 became a small chief, and founded a dynasty that rules the little 
 country of Fiou to this day. 
 
 The Foulbe dynasty was particularly distinguished, from one 
 
 JENNE 
 
 point of view, by its detestation of Europeans. It was at the 
 instigation of Cheikou Ahmadou that Major Laing was killed on 
 leaving Timbuctoo. Later, in 1834, Ahmadou persistently sought 
 the death of Earth, who gives a very full account of the dangers 
 he escaped, and of how it was to El Backay, the Kounta sheik, 
 that he owed his life. This hatred was again manifested quite 
 recently. In 1891 a lieutenant of the marines, M. Spitzer, sent as 
 ambassador to Ahmadou Abdoulay, was very nearly assassinated 
 in the capital one night ; it was entirely owing to the swiftness 
 of his horse that he escaped. This kinglet, alarmed by our un- 
 ceasing progress, has since humbly implored pardon and paid 
 tribute. 
 
140 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 The death of Ahmadou Ahmadou was speedily followed by 
 that of his conqueror. El Hadj Omar was scarcely installed in 
 the capital of his foe before he was attacked by an army of 
 Foulbes, accompanied by a reinforcement of Kountas. The 
 Toucouleur held out for several months, but the town was finally 
 captured. He succeeded in escaping to the neighbouring moun- 
 tains of Bandiagara, and there he learned in his turn to know 
 all the desolation of defeat which had been suffered by Ahmadou 
 Ahmadou. His death, not so heroic as that of his victim, came 
 about in the following manner. Being pursued by his enemies 
 he sought refuge in a cave, which they surrounded and blew up 
 with gunpowder, and El Hadj Omar perished in its ruins 
 (1863). 
 
 The Toucouleurs, under the government of Tidiani, a nephew 
 of the late king, still remained masters of the north of the valley. 
 Tidiani was succeeded by his son, who was opposed by his brothers 
 in a series of civil wars which terminated in 1877, leaving Ahma- 
 dou sole ruler. 
 
 A new prophet entered the scenes about this time, he too 
 massacring and pillaging in the name of God. He was 
 Samory, that scourge of the valley and of the left bank of the 
 Niger. 
 
 But little by little, under the directions of General Borgnis- 
 Desbordes, our forts advanced towards the great river, and we 
 were installed upon its banks at Bammaku in 1883. Our gunners 
 made us known in the north while our columns pursued Samory 
 in the south. Colonel Archinard continued our march along the 
 course of the Niger, and the capture of Segu marked the termina- 
 tion of the Toucouleur dominion in 1892. We reached Jenne in 
 1893, and before the end of the same year the tricolour flag waved 
 over Timbuctoo. 
 
THE MOORS IN THE SUDAN 141 
 
 These few pages of history, and the fresh information they 
 contain, are not necessary only to explain Jenne and its Egyp- 
 tian architecture, they have another claim on our atten- 
 tion. 
 
 They serve to show that we have taken possession of the 
 Sudan at an exceptionally favourable moment as far as ease 
 of conquest is concerned. But they also show that we 
 arrived after two hundred years of its worst misfortunes, and 
 at a time singularly unpropitious to the prosperity of the 
 country. 
 
 The Moors were the first cause of the work of disintegra- 
 tion, which steadily increased during the two centuries of 
 their reign, to reach its maximum in the present day. The 
 history of this disruption is a tissue of accumulated misery and 
 desolation. 
 
 We find the country in a most abnormal political and 
 economical position, a position which is general, not localised 
 and partial. From north, east, and south Touaregs, Foulbes, 
 Toucouleurs and Kountas have flung their starveling herds into this 
 promised land. They appear in the light of some monstrous 
 association eager to destroy the happy privileges nature showered 
 upon these rich territories, and labouring to annihilate the 
 benefits of an ancient civilisation in the triumph of their 
 native barbarism. And all this in the name of the one God ! 
 Cheikou Ahmadou, El Hadj Omar, and Samory were not the 
 only devastating prophets. I have pruned numerous other 
 fanatic and sanguinary meteors from these pages who account 
 for a lesser share of the great sum of evil. 
 
 During all this time agriculture was interrupted and commerce 
 destroyed. The river was deserted of its canoes, and the traffic of 
 the caravan became impossible. The markets were empty, the 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 population decimated by slavery and famine, and entire countries 
 were depopulated by emigration. 
 
 The negro race is so prolific, however, thanks to polygamy, 
 and the earth is so fertile, thanks to the inundations of the Niger, 
 that all these evils will be repaired in a few years owing to the 
 peace and organisation we have introduced in the country. 
 
CHAPTER VIII 
 
 JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 
 
 DURING the miseries of the three centuries following upon the 
 Moorish conquest Gao disappeared. The Touaregs swept through 
 it, and left behind them a mere fraction of the grandeur and 
 civilisation, the customs and ancestral traditions, of the Songhoi 
 capital. Barth was fortunate in finding even the site of the city 
 remaining. A massive tower (such as we see at Timbuctoo), 
 representing both the ruin of the grand mosque and the tomb of 
 Mohammed Askia, was, with the exception of a few native huts, 
 ail that he found there. 
 
 Jenne, most happily, has reached us nearly intact. So com- 
 plete is this town that we can trace the thoughts and life of the 
 Songhoi people in it better than we could ever have done at Gao. 
 By what miracle has it been preserved ? By none, but simply by 
 the exceptionally privileged position of the town and its surround- 
 ing country. The land here marvellously resembles that of 
 Egypt, and the emigrants were evidently struck by the similarity, 
 realising that their peculiar qualities would best thrive in this 
 place. 
 
 What more could they ask than this vast plain, periodically 
 inundated by the united rise of the Niger and its confluent the 
 Bani. The Kouakouru, a curious and important channel, connects 
 these rivers with Jenne. From July to November the stream

 '? of Paris. 
 
 flows from the Bani to the Niger, for the four succeeding months 
 it flows from the Niger to the Bani, and during the rest of the 
 year it has no current at all. This alternation has been remarked 
 by the natives, and recorded in the following na'ive observation : 
 c Our country is watered by two great rivers that marry at Mopti. 
 The Bani is the male, and the Niger is the female element. At 
 
 first the Bani fills 
 the Niger, but 
 some time after- 
 wards the Niger, 
 grown great, re- 
 turns its fulness 
 to the Bani.' 
 
 The scientific 
 explanation of 
 this phenomenon 
 is simple. The 
 Niger and the 
 Bani pursue an 
 almost parallel course, and are enlarged at the same period 
 of the year by the same rains. The course of the Niger is 
 impeded, however, by great natural dams, and it has in addition 
 to fill the Pools of Dia and Bourgoo, while that of the 
 Bani is free, and augments no reservoirs. Inasmuch as the 
 waters of the Niger are more considerable, the two rivers do 
 not overflow at the same time of the year. The Bani rises first, 
 and as it encounters no obstacle, and suffers no diminution, it can 
 by means of the Kouakouru, transfer its superabundance to the 
 Niger. The larger river attains its fullest height later on, and it 
 is then the Niger that flows into its diminished confluent. The 
 immense plain is flooded from September to October, and during 
 
 MAP OF JENNERI 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 145 
 
 this period the waters of the Bani are at their highest. This is 
 not the case with the Niger, but its mass is nevertheless greatly 
 augmented, and forms a barrier against the rapid currents of the 
 Bani at Mopti. The level of the latter, owing to this dam of 
 water, begins to rise. The Pool of Kouakouru and the various 
 channels rise also, and the surrounding country, owing to the 
 absence of protective dykes, is flooded. At this period the 
 appearance of the region closely resembles that of the valley of 
 the Nile in times of inundation. The villages of the Songhoi 
 agriculturist emerge from the sheet of water like those of the 
 Fellahs. They are built of the same light grey clay upon mounds 
 more or less artificial, and are interspersed with the same feathery 
 tufts of palm-trees. The roads and the banks of river, channels, 
 and pools have entirely disappeared, canoes being the only means 
 of communication remaining to the villagers. The great plain 
 has become a great sea strewn with grey islands crested with 
 green. 
 
 The waters subside in November, and rice (the principal cereal 
 of this region), having been planted in the first rains, is then 
 harvested. The soil being moist and easily worked, a second 
 harvest of millet or maize is prepared. The wonderful fertility of 
 the grouud is such that two closely consecutive harvests may be 
 obtained from it. 
 
 'Fortune has showered its gifts upon Jenneri, 1 says the old 
 chronicle ; ' its markets are held every day of the week, and its 
 populations are very numerous. Its seven thousand villages are 
 so near to one another that the chief of Jenne has no need of 
 messengers. If he wishes to send a command to Lake Debo, for 
 instance, it is cried from the gate of the town, and repeated from 
 village to village, by which means it reaches its destination almost 
 instantly."

 The meeting of many channels in this golden land severs an 
 island from the plain, and that island is Jenne. 
 
 Was it chance, or was it intention resulting from inquiry, that 
 drew the first Songhois to establish here the frontier town of 
 their empire? It matters very little; inspiration or choice was 
 equally remarkable. 
 
 The position was impregnable. If it were attacked in the fall 
 
 THE ISLAND AND TOWN OF JENNE 
 
 of the rivers, when its girdle of waters was fordable in parts, its 
 banks (from twenty to sixteen feet high), crowned by a ten-foot 
 wall, still presented an inaccessible front. In the floods the enemy 
 would have required special apparatus and instruments of war 
 which were unknown in those days. To starve it into capitulation 
 would have been the work of at least two years ; and it would 
 have needed a formidable army to blockade both land and water, 
 for Jenne is defended by its channels, pools, and floods as much as 
 by its walls. 
 
 Its inhabitants do not forget to tell you that Jenne, alone 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 147 
 
 among all the cities of the Sudan, was never taken, destroyed, 
 nor pillaged. The Tarik confirms this assertion. When Gao 
 and the rest of the Songhoi empire became the tributaries and 
 vassals of the powerful kingdom of the Mali, Jenne and its people 
 remained independent. ' There were many battles, nearly a 
 hundred, and the people of Jenne were always victorious. After 
 the last defeat the Malinkas said, "We will come again"; but in 
 this year (1664) in which I write, the hundredth battle has not 
 been fought, and the Malinkas have not returned.'' 
 
 Proud of its wealth and conscious of its power, was it at the 
 height of the Mali supremacy that Jenne broke loose from the 
 links binding it to the decadent Songhoi empire, and asserted its 
 independence ? Most probably it was, inasmuch as, somewhere 
 about that time (fourteenth century), the army of Mossi took 
 Timbuctoo, and separated Jenne completely and effectively from 
 the rest of the empire. When Sunni Ali restored the power of 
 the Songhois, his longest and most obstinately opposed campaign 
 was directed against these people. He invested the town, and, 
 according to some, he devoted seven years, seven months, and 
 seven days to the siege ; others allow only four years. However 
 that may be, his entire army was collected in the country for so 
 long a period that his soldiers turned farmers. Jenne being 
 suddenly threatened with famine, the chief of the town proposed 
 peace, and Sunni Ali, wearied out on his side, hastened to accord 
 the most honourable terms. So far from humiliating it in the 
 day of its capitulation, he seated his former enemy on his right 
 hand, married his mother, and, most important of all as far as we 
 are concerned, he respected the town. 
 
 Thus returned to the bosom of the Songhoi empire, Jenne 
 supported her lot with resignation. In the Moorish conquest she 
 compounded with the victors, as she did later with the Foulbes, 
 
148 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 and again a hundred years after with the Toucouleurs. She would 
 have spontaneously opened her gates to Colonel Archinard had it 
 not been for Alpha Moussa, the commander of the Toucouleur 
 garrison. 
 
 Jenne possesses another advantage in its insular position, from 
 an archaeological point of view. The town, being built in a 
 comparatively limited space, could not invite the settlement of 
 foreign elements in any numbers sufficient to influence her appear- 
 ance and customs. In another situation the city would have 
 enlarged into suburbs, which, being incorporated with the town, 
 would, by degrees, have modified its earlier aspect, as was 
 evidently the case at Gao. But Jenne in her island has remained 
 as completely herself as if she had been enclosed in a tower of 
 ivory. 
 
 We know that the palaces and temples of the Pharaohs were 
 raised by blows of the lash, and the fathers of the Songhois pro- 
 bably laboured under them. The builders of these edifices were 
 themselves content with modest earthen dwellings; and if the 
 construction of houses in the new country had been a matter of 
 quarrying and shaping blocks of stone, they would have been 
 satisfied with the primitive native hut, and I should not have seen 
 a city of the Pharaohs existing to this day. Fortunately the 
 Songhois discovered a suitable material for the building of their 
 town, which was neither the granite nor sandstone of Egyptian 
 monuments, but was merely a clay, plentifully found in the island 
 and its neighbourhood. Humble as it was, to these new-comers 
 it must have been inestimably precious, since it replaced that mud 
 which the negro is obliged to solidify by mixing with gravel, 
 manure, or any filth that comes to hand before he can build witli 
 it. It was not the wretched banco that makes Segu so unhealthy 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 149 
 
 when the deluges of the winter season soak into the infected 
 sponges that represent its houses, but was a good stiff clay, solid, 
 resisting, and wholesome. 
 
 They were enabled to make regular bricks from it, flat, long, 
 
 BRICK-MAKING 
 
 and rounded at the ends like those of ancient Egypt. Except in 
 the Songhoi countries, the negro does not proceed thus, but is 
 content to fashion his banco into irregular balls as he uses them. 
 These bricks, being baked by the fierce Sudanese sun, are set in 
 the walls with mortar, and finally receive a special rough-casting. 
 Dwellings thus constructed are of great durability, and have all 
 the appearance of being cut from one enormous block of stone. 
 They defy the heaviest tornadoes of rain and wind in an astonish- 
 ing manner, and with some repairing, which consists entirely of 
 renewed rough-casting, they last for centuries. 
 
 These clay bricks are admirably suited to the massive and 
 
150 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 simple lines of Egyptian architecture, and the Songhois could 
 build on as large a scale with them as could the Pharaohs with 
 their great blocks of stone. Owing to their being enabled to work 
 quickly and easily with this clay, the town could be begun and 
 completed while the memory of their native country was still 
 vividly before them. 
 
 Above all, the houses of Jenne display that essenjtial charac- 
 teristic of Egyptian art the pyramidal form, which represented 
 solidity to those ancient architects. The walls of the oldest 
 constructions have a slight inward inclination, and possess no 
 windows, or only the roughest sketch of them. Light and air 
 enter through openings cut in the ceiling or roof. In all the 
 negro habitations the roofs are rounded to carry off the terrible 
 deluges of winter, but here they are flat, like those of the valley of 
 the Nile, where rain is scarce. The Songhois knew no more how 
 to construct an arch than did the Egyptians. The summits of 
 their dwellings are ornamented by those triangular battlements 
 which may be seen on the palaces of Rameses Meiamoun. The 
 pylon, which is another characteristic of Egyptian architecture, 
 gives access to the dwellings of Jenne, and forms, too, a motive of 
 decoration, the facades of the houses being adorned with great 
 buttresses of pylonic form. You would suppose these buttresses 
 were intended to give additional support to the edifice, but inter- 
 rogation of the local architects convinces you that they are merely 
 ornamental adjuncts. Moreover, they are only to be found in the 
 houses of the wealthy, though the poorer dwellings are no less 
 solidly constructed. On certain buildings two of these pylons are 
 united at their summit by a projecting plinth, recalling the ancient 
 propylon. In short, the effect of the whole, its harmonious pro- 
 portions, the symmetrical distribution of its ornamental motives, 
 and its massiveness, unmistakably proclaim the art of Egypt. 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 151 
 
 If we refer to the antique bas-reliefs which reproduce the 
 principal features of the ancient Egyptian habitations, and to the 
 works of the orientalists, we shall find they agree in every par- 
 ticular with the buildings of Jenne. 'The private houses were 
 simple, and were not constructed of stone nor granite, as were the 
 temples and palaces, but of rough bricks. The walls were 
 
 plastered within and without, and enclosed a suite of rooms which 
 were not uniformly disposed, but were divided according to the 
 taste of the proprietor. They consisted of a ground floor and a 
 second floor surmounted by a terrace. The approaches to the 
 wealthiest houses were adorned with pylons and obelisks. The 
 summits and angles of the clay walls were finished by a kind of 
 framework of reeds held together by transverse bands. The roof 
 was flat, and formed by placing planks across the length and 
 breadth of the house ; branches and rushes were strewn upon them, 
 
152 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 and the whole was covered by a thin layer of earth reduced to the 
 consistency of mud. This covering slightly projected from all 
 sides of the wall. 1 
 
 The same methods of construction are pursued in the buildings 
 of Jenne ; all these details are to be found, with others that are 
 veritably stupefying when seen in the heart of a negro country. A 
 system of baked pipes is established in every dwelling to carry 
 away the household water, and latrines, with perfectly constructed 
 drainage, are established on all the terraces. 
 
 The survival, through all those ages, of this method of building 
 is due, not only to the fact that the town has never been destroyed, 
 but also to the great durability of the houses. I was shown some 
 which were three or four hundred years old, their age being proved 
 by the fact that their ground floors were about three feet below 
 the level of the street outside. Centuries of layers have raised 
 these roads as they have those of Jerusalem, which stands to-day 
 fourteen or sixteen feet above its original level. Successive 
 generations always possessed, therefore, some models of ancient 
 times, and their types have been handed down to the present day. 
 The great pent-houses with which some are supplied form their 
 chief digression. This addition to the principal doors was pro- 
 voked by the torrents of rain which threatened to flood the 
 ground floors. They are massively designed, somewhat resembling 
 the mantles of our ancient fireplaces, and are in nowise out of 
 harmony with the fa9ades. One or two courts are arranged inside 
 the dwellings, and the few openings for air and light in the latter 
 are embellished with slabs of terra-cotta, ornamentally designed, 
 and set in the walls. The Moors, who installed themselves at 
 Jenne after the conquest, introduced the use of windows with 
 wooden shutters in the Arabian style, the only growth of their 
 art they succeeded in engrafting. Moreover, these windows were 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 153 
 
 not manufactured in Jenne, but were imported whole from 
 Timbuctoo. 
 
 The Egyptian originality of the town must have been greatly 
 jeopardised by the Moorish arrival, for the new-comers, impreg- 
 nated as they were with Arabian art, would assuredly attempt 
 other innovations. Thanks to its precious clay, however, Jenne 
 remained unspoiled, for this substance did not lend itself to the 
 construction of little columns and colonnades, and Moorish arcades, 
 nor was it suitable for arabesques and all that slenderness of detail 
 that have caused Fez and Marrakesh to resemble Cairo and Algiers. 
 Some adaptations would doubtless be attempted, but they would 
 crumble away in the first rains, and thus the city has remained 
 faithful to its ancient traditions, preserving through twelve cen- 
 turies indubitable proofs of its origin. 
 
 Although private houses are numerous, the type of monu- 
 mental edifice is lacking. It did exist, however. The domicile of 
 the governor of Jenne was of much greater dimensions than those 
 of the ordinary dwelling ; his rank, and the custom of maintaining 
 a numerous retinue, would require it. His house, which was called 
 the Madou, would have supplied us with the missing example of 
 the Songhoi palace, but unfortunately in the eleventh century an 
 event occurred which swept away this monument. 'The town 
 remained pagan," reports the Tarik and popular tradition, ' until 
 the fifth century of the Hegira (1050). At that period it followed 
 the example of its chief Koumbourou, and adopted Islamism. The 
 chief convoked all the ulemas of the country, and more than four 
 thousand obeyed the summons. Koumbourou, having shaved his 
 head in their presence and announced his conversion, asked the 
 ulemas to address the following prayer to God in favour of the 
 town : ' That any person who should arrive there, having quitted 
 
154 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 his country from poverty and an inability to live in it, should 
 receive from God such abundant and easy means of life that 
 he should forget his native land. That Jenne should become 
 a great centre of commerce, and that its inhabitants should 
 be overwhelmed with wealth.' This the ulemas did, and 
 the prosperity of the town is a proof that God heard their 
 prayers. 
 
 On becoming a Mussulman Koumbourou destroyed his palace 
 and built a mosque upon its site. He lived to see its completion, 
 .but it was his successor who surrounded it with walls. 
 
 The zeal of the neophyte has thus robbed us of the sight 
 of an ancient Songhoi palace. The fact is the more lamentable 
 that the various Sudanese chronicles give no compensating de- 
 scription of the building. The temple that was built to the 
 new God somewhat attenuates these regrets, however, for the 
 grand mosque of Jenne was long famous in the valley of the 
 Niger, being considered more beautiful than the Kasbah of 
 Mecca itself. 
 
 It was an enormous block, rigidly square, its sides measuring 
 one hundred and eighty-three feet long by thirty-nine feet high. 
 Besides the usual pylonic adornments, three groups of buttresses 
 were distributed on each facade. Every group was composed of 
 three deep ridges, possessing a projection of nine feet at the base, 
 which diminished as they rose. The first of these groups was 
 thirty-two feet from the angles of the building, and they were 
 separated from one another by an interval of about twenty-six 
 feet. The walls were crowned with triangular battlements 
 separated by the terminating ridges of the buttresses, which were 
 of similar form, but greater in height. The building was oriented 
 with each faade towards one of the cardinal points, but the sides 
 were not absolutely uniform with one another.

 The north and south facades displayed two rows of windows, 1 
 The north gave admission to the faithful through two doors, the 
 south through one only. The eastern (which was the sacred side, 
 that looked towards Mecca), was uninterrupted by either door or 
 window, and its sur- 
 face was only broken, 
 by pylonic adorn- 
 ments and the three 
 groups of buttresses. 
 The western side was 
 also without a door.

 edifice was composed 4 )mb of -.

 of two stories. It 
 was nothing of the 
 kind ; they lighted a 
 closed gallery which ran round the square. Opposite the sacred 
 eastern side was a row of nine triforiums. 2 Their dimensions were 
 analogous to those of the gallery which formed the veritable 
 body and sanctuary of the edifice. The interior was softly gloomy, 
 its only light being admitted through some openings in the high 
 ceiling, by reflections grudgingly let in by the two passages, by 
 some windows in the great gallery, and by the two doors opening 
 on to the court of the mosque. This latter occupied a wide space 
 
 1 The windows form squares of nineteen inches at a three-foot interval. The first 
 jow is sixteen feet from the ground, and the second twenty-four feet or thereabouts. 
 
 2 Each triforium formed a gallery of little less than six feet six inches wide by 
 thirty-two feet high. The walls of this part were rather more than two feet thick, 
 while the walls of the gallery were about four feet thick.

 in front of the ninth triforium, and measured one hundred and 
 fifty feet long, by sixty-five wide. 
 
 In the centre of the building, between the seventh and ninth 
 triforiums, rose a quadrangular tower, of which two sides measured 
 twenty-six feet at the base. Steps were cut in it, and it opened 
 on to the terraced roof by means of an edicule, from which a 
 marabut called the faithful to the five daily prayers. Another of 
 these edicules was placed in the centre of the eastern side. 
 
 A low wall ran round the building at a distance of sixteen 
 feet from it, widening respectfully to sixty-five feet before the 
 sacred facade, and forming there a spacious parade. This was 
 the holy ground in which the venerated marabuts, together with 
 the scholars and people of importance, reposed in their last sleep. 
 It was their Pantheon, and this chosen cemetery harmonised with 
 the high wall that looked towards the Kasbah. With its ridged 
 buttresses alternating with pylons, and with no doors nor windows 
 to break its uniform grandeur by a note of life, this eastern 
 facade gave a very forcible impression of a mausoleum. 
 
 The mosque was built on rising ground in the south of the 
 town. A great excavation at its feet provided the materials for 
 its construction, and served to further separate it from the town, 
 so that it stood out from the surrounding fortifications and 
 houses, soaring above them like a castle. 
 
 Is it necessary to refer once more to -the Egyptian atavism 
 revealed in its massive dimensions, in the plan and symmetry of 
 its construction ? Is it not better to dwell upon the fact that the 
 only materials employed by its architects were clay and wood, and 
 yet, in spite of that, their work lasted eight centuries ? 
 
 It still survived sixty years ago, and would have lasted many 
 centuries longer if Cheikou Ahmadou, the great Foulbe conqueror, 
 had not commanded its destruction in 1830. 
 
>* 
 
158 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 For a long time this command remained inexplicable to me. 
 How came a prince, a well-known fanatic, to destroy a mosque ? 
 'Because there were so many mosques,' said one. 'Because it 
 claimed to be more beautiful than that of Mecca," said another, 
 with greater probability. Priestly amour-propre caused them to 
 conceal the true reason, and it was a priestly jealousy that revealed 
 it to me. 
 
 I was holding a seance of human documents one day, and 
 among its members were three marabuts ; two of them were 
 natives of Jenne, and the third was from Segu. In this religious 
 society I did not fail to return to the question of the destruction 
 of the mosque. Quite in vain ; the two natives reiterated the 
 same imbecile reasons I had already heard, while the third sat 
 silent, obstinately studying his sandals. 
 
 It did not occur to me that there had been any special signifi- 
 cance in this attitude, until I saw him mysteriously reappear very 
 early next morning. After rapidly examining my dwelling upon 
 all sides, he entered, and closing the door, he assumed the attitude 
 of the evening before, saying, ' You asked us why Cheikou 
 Ahmadou destroyed the old mosque. I know the reason, but the 
 history of it is unpleasant to Jenne, and the marabuts naturally 
 do not care to repeat it. That is why I did not tell it to you 
 yesterday. I will do so now, and you shall go to them, saying, Is 
 this true ? ' 
 
 Which I did ; and the two marabuts confirmed the story, pre- 
 tending to have learned it in the interval. 
 
 Part of Cheikou Ahmadou's youth had been spent in Jenne. 
 He was sent there by his parents to acquire learning from the 
 numerous marabuts and scholars of the place. As his family was 
 neither rich nor powerful, the young man was forced to lead the 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 159 
 
 life of a poor student, and the alms of wealthy merchants were his 
 sole support. The town was prosperous, and the Sudan was 
 enjoying its last years of comparative tranquillity. Plenty of 
 amusements went on in Jenne, and strangers lived a joyous life 
 there, thanks to the laxity that prevailed in manners and matters 
 of religion. 
 
 Young Ahrnadou, who, like most of the Foulbes, was austere 
 both from necessity and a rigid faith Ahmadou, who was destined 
 to take the title of Emir of the True Believers, conceived a great 
 horror of all this depravity. The special quarters of the corrup- 
 tion were none other than the precincts of the old mosque. The 
 centre of debauch was just opposite that sacred eastern wall which 
 should have recalled the image of the Kasbah to the minds of the 
 faithful, and dances were held there to the sounds of tom-tom 
 and bafalon. Owing to its numerous foreign elements, the town 
 could supply the whole repertoire of the lascivious dances of the 
 Sudan. The neighbouring huts sold an intoxicating drink (a 
 kind of beer called dolo), which was naturally forbidden to 
 Mohammedans. An evening thus begun often terminated in low 
 houses erected close to the west wall of the mosque, and even 
 more frequently the dancers sauntered about the galleries of the 
 mosque itself. Already full of ambitious plans, Cheikou Ahmadou 
 swore to put an end to these scandals on the day that God should 
 put the power in his hands. 
 
 Twenty- five years later, having destroyed the power of the 
 Koumas and taken Timbuctoo and Jenne, he kept his word. He 
 also forbade idolatrous strangers to enter the town, as he con- 
 sidered them the first cause of the corruption. In order to still 
 further punish Jenne, he founded a new capital on the right bank 
 of the Bani, calling it El-Lamdou-Lillahi (To the praise of God), 
 the Hamdallai of to-day. Finally, to purify the quarter in which 
 
160 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 the dancing and drinking had taken place, he built the new 
 mosque, which, simple, bare, and common-place, marks the spot 
 to this day. When it was completed he ordained his son and 
 successor, Ahmadou Cheikou, his grand Iman, and then he 
 commanded the destruction of the old mosque (1830). 
 
 All that now remains of it is a heap of ruins, surrounded and 
 preserved by their enclosing walls. The interior of the edifice 
 has disappeared, the triforiums, the ceiling, the galleries, and the 
 two towers are totally effaced. The great walls offered more 
 resistance to the destroyers, and are only partially broken through. 
 With the assistance of these, and the memories of the old men, 
 my work of re-construction was easy enough. The rows of 
 windows are fairly distinguishable, so are the indented lines of the 
 terrace and the positions of the great buttresses. Guided by 
 these indications it was not difficult to trace the walls of the 
 triforiums, the minarets, and the extent of the court. The only 
 consolation left for its destruction lies in the fact that it is now 
 possible to verify the great antiquity of the monument. This is 
 easily done by a method resembling that of the woodman, who 
 determines the age of a tree by the concentric circles of its trunk. 
 From the great walls of the facade, whose normal thickness 
 was three feet, I removed a layer of rough-casting not less than 
 thirty-five inches thick. According to the old houses, the masons 
 allowed about four inches a century, which would take us back 
 to the eleventh century, and this date would correspond with that 
 given by the Tarik. 
 
 The venerated tombs were the only things respected by 
 Cheikou Ahmadou, and they now form a cemetery, or rather a 
 charnel-house, in which I spent many hours of research. I had 
 no idea that I was in a place of tombs and corpses the first time 
 I saw it. The surface of the earth was pierced here and there by

 terra-cotta pipes similar to those employed in the household 
 drainage of the town. Here, planted vertically in the soil, you 
 would take them for the chimneys of troglodyte dwellings. But 
 on looking down these supposed chimneys you find them full of 
 earth; they are connected with subterranean dwellings, however, 
 for this is the abode of the dead, and these pipes mark their tombs. 
 In some places the earth had fallen through, and I could 
 
 THE CEMETERY IN THE MIDST OF THE RUINS 
 
 distinguish piles of skeletons that were only separated from one 
 another by thin layers of earth. The dead sleep so closely to one 
 another that in a short time there will be more human dust than 
 earth in this little place. One seldom sees the living in this spot, 
 but there is life here, of a sort, that is very intense and active, and 
 is produced by the dead lying below the red tubes. 
 
 Eagles and crows, hovering overhead, swoop suddenly down 
 upon the dogs and rats that dig up the tombs. Legions of 
 red and yellow lizards frisk unconcernedly about in this world 
 of worms and insects. Goats and their kids make pretty spots of 
 white and red against the sombre tones of the ruined walls. They

 too find a living in this dead heap ; the grass must be savoury here, 
 and they can enjoy such delightful climbs among these ruins. 
 But the kings of the place are the enormous iguanas green, and 
 large as crocodiles ; the daintiest morsels of the charnel-house are 
 for them, and they have traced long passages from drain to drain. 
 They find many a feast there corpses, and worms that they snap 
 up with their long double tongues, rats, lizards, scorpions, and 
 others. The ground is littered with the remains of its inhabi- 
 tants : tibias and shoulder-blades here, femurs there, with occasional 
 shreds of intestines. There are no skulls. Is it possible that the 
 animals consider as inferior that part which man values most ? 
 
 All this is not in the least sad or gloomy. At the foot of the 
 ruins, from town, market, and crowd, mount the great sounds of 
 life. The sun pours its floods of intense light and gaiety upon 
 this double death ; upon those mounds where the works of God 
 and the works of man are done with, and are crumbling away 
 together. 
 
 6 Jenne is one of the greatest commercial towns of Islam. The 
 salt of Thegazza and the gold of Boundou are sought there, and 
 its inhabitants have acquired great riches. Good fortune is in its 
 soil, and on account of this blessed city men come to Timbuctoo 
 from all parts/ 
 
 So says an old Sudanese chronicle of the sixteenth century. 
 How did such a commercial centre come about ? and why at 
 Jenne rather than any other town ? The reason is to be found in 
 the wealth and configuration of this part of the Sudan. 
 
 The wonderful fertility of the soil yields, as we know, a pro- 
 fusion of exchangeable produce, and the hydrographic system, 
 which gives such exceptional irrigation to agriculture, also offers 
 means of transport which is all that could be desired. These 
 great advantages are not peculiar to Jenne, however, but are 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 165 
 
 common to all the towns above and below her. Moreover, if her 
 insular position was an excellent one from point of view of 
 security, it was a serious drawback where communication was 
 concerned. Segu and Sansanding on one side, and Mopti, 
 Korienza, Sa, and Sarafara on the other, possessed the advantage 
 of being situated on the Niger itself; yet Jenne was the town 
 that attained the greatest celebrity. She not only ranked above 
 Timbuctoo, but took her place among the great commercial centres 
 of Islam. And why ? 
 
 Because, among all the towns of the Niger, Jenne alone was a 
 Songhoi city. Because her inhabitants bore within them the 
 germs of the great Egyptian civilisation. Because, from the midst 
 of the gloom of barbarity which covered the whole of the valley, 
 Jenne stood out as the luminous point in which the cultured man 
 appeared. Because this culture gave Jenne conceptions, and the 
 means for executing them, that were unknown to her rivals. 
 
 In place of the primitive barter between village and village, 
 and market and market, she created a true commerce. Her in- 
 habitants formulated ' business firms,' in the European sense of 
 the word, which were provided with a routine and staff similar to 
 our own. They established representatives in important centres 
 and opened branches at Timbuctoo. They sent out travelling 
 agents who received so much per cent, on the business they accom- 
 plished, and were, in fact, no other than our 'commercial 
 travellers. 1 The staff was composed of relatives and slaves, or free 
 men who were obliged to earn their living. Among their numbers 
 there were occasionally, as with us, certain indelicate members 
 who disappeared with the merchandise that had been intrusted 
 to them. 
 
 Thus organised, Jenne drains the whole of the Sudan in 
 general, and the south of the valley in particular, through the 
 
166 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 medium of the markets of Baramandougou, San, and Bla. The 
 ground floors of its large houses serve as spacious bonded ware- 
 houses by means of which their merchandise is not exposed to the 
 rain and numerous parasites, as is the negro's. These storehouses 
 are filled with cereals, great sacks of rice and millet, jars full 
 of honey, blocks of karita covered with leaves and bound with 
 rushes, arachides, spices, onions, cakes of indigo, baskets of kola- 
 nuts, neta flour, monkey bread (the fruit of the baobab), and 
 bars of a wonderful iron brought from Karaguana (a country 
 near Mossi), packets of ostrich feathers, ivory, virgin gold, civet 
 musk ; lead from the mountains of Hombouri and marble bracelets 
 from the same place (ornaments greatly affected by the inhabi- 
 tants of Nigerian countries) ; antimony, used by the negresses 
 to darken the orbits of their eyes and increase their brilliancy 
 the blonde among them (for there are fair negresses) using it 
 to darken their complexions ; native fabrics, fine linen and 
 woollen textiles, long white lengths of stuff from which the 
 ample garments of these people are made, pagnes de Segu for 
 the women, and superb large draperies artistically patterned in 
 yellow, black, copper-colour, and blue. I must not forget to 
 mention another kind of -merchandise, warehoused in the same 
 place and as much in demand as any of the preceding, namely, 
 slaves. 
 
 There is no specialisation of trade. Every one sells every- 
 thing : textiles, human flesh, cereals, metals, and spices. These 
 merchants do not carry on their real trade in the market they 
 merely send thither agents provided with a small stock ; their 
 true business is done in the penumbra of their large Egyptian 
 dwellings. 
 
 With this abundance of products, the means of assembling, 
 and shops to shelter them, there still remains the problem of 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 167 
 
 transport. It was Jenne that taught the Sudanese the art of 
 commercial navigation. Its boats could be compared with the 
 aboriginal pirogue as little as the town could with a native city 
 or its houses with the native huts. The negroes canoe is a mere 
 sketch of a boat, hollowed out from the trunk of a tree, and at 
 the mercy of the least of the Niger's breezes. It can only carry 
 the smallest of cargoes, and, in order not to capsize it, the occu- 
 pants are obliged to sit motionless as a Buddha in a Hindu temple 
 or practise the agility of a Japanese equilibrist. 
 
 But the people of Jenne built regular vessels that were large 
 and steady. The framework or body is not formed of regular 
 planks adjusted and nailed to the keel, as one would expect, 
 but is made of irregular blocks of Kaicedra ebony or cedar- 
 wood. These blocks are pierced with holes, then juxtaposed like 
 pieces of Mosaic, and held together by 
 
 BUILDING A LARGE BOAT 
 
 strong hempen cords ; the recipe apparently being : Take holes 
 and surround them with rope and wood. They are finally made 
 sufficiently water-tight by means of straw, tow, and clay ; this 
 method of construction imparting to them an elasticity that is 
 highly desirable in view of the frequent groundings encountered 
 on the sandbanks of the river. 
 
 Not being limited to the size of a tree-trunk, the Songhois 
 construct Jboats measuring between fifty-eight and sixty-five feet 
 
168 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 long by ten broad, and able to carry from twenty to thirty tons. 
 To convey the same weight by land would necessitate a caravan 
 of a thousand porters, or two hundred camels or three hundred 
 bullocks. Instead of any one of these costly methods, a single 
 vessel, with from six to ten boatmen, is all that is required, 
 which clearly proves the superiority of Jenne to the surrounding 
 country. 
 
 Its great merchants have their own boats devoted exclusively 
 to transport. The less wealthy have fleets of regular fly-boats at 
 their disposal, which carry merchandise and passengers at a fixed 
 tariff. Bars of iron, blocks of karita, jars, anything, in short, 
 that water cannot damage, are stored in the hold, and upon these 
 are piled sacks of cereals and the more delicate merchandise. A 
 compact mass is thus obtained which forms the deck, and upon 
 this the passengers lie or squat, protected by an awning from the 
 sun. A space is left in the middle of the hold for baling out and 
 cooking purposes. These fly-boats travel all day, and only stop 
 at sunset for the evening meal ; when there is a moon the journey 
 is resumed as soon as it rises. For a consideration of 1500 cowries 
 (2 frs. 50 c.) you can go to Timbuctoo (a twenty days' journey), 
 or for three francs you can send thither a hundredweight of 
 goods. 
 
 Other towns, such as Sansanding, Korienza, and Sarafara, 
 learned how to construct these large boats, which, wherever they 
 may have been built, are invariably called ' Jenne boats.' Little 
 by little an active commercial movement was diffused among the 
 labyrinths of the Niger. But Jenne still retained her position 
 as metropolis, owing partly to the superiority of her inventive 
 resources, and partly to her isolation, which protected her from 
 the sudden cataclysms and destructions to which the other cities 
 were subject. 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 169 
 
 By means of her numerous fleets, her more civilised manners, 
 progress and architecture spread throughout the western valley, 
 even penetrating to Timbtictoo and the Kong country. After 
 leaving Bammaku I found adaptations of her architecture every- 
 where : in the facades of the royal dwellings of Segu and in the 
 town gates. All the mosques, though of more modest propor- 
 tions, are built in the style of the old mosque at Jenne. 
 
 The sole point of contact between these vast regions and the 
 Songhoi world, Jenne had morally dominated them long before 
 they were actually conquered by the kings of her race. With 
 this supremacy augmented by her fabulous wealth, it is small 
 wonder that she was enabled to hold her own in ' nearly a hundred 
 battles ' against the Mali kings, who were practically the masters 
 of the valley. Her work of civilisation continued uninterruptedly 
 through centuries. Slowly she prepared the Western Sudan for 
 
 JENNE : A CORNER OF THE QUAY 
 
170 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 that sudden and brilliant flight revealed by history in the great 
 century of the Askias (1500-1600). 
 
 This civilising role would be a title in itself to a place in the 
 memories of mankind, but she possessed another of equal import- 
 ance : she could claim to be the foundress of Timbuctoo. 
 
 Her commercial attention must have been fixed from the first 
 upon that inestimable commodity which the Sudan lacked, viz. 
 salt. The caravans bringing it from the Thegazza mines returned 
 by the interior, instead of diverging to the east towards the river. 
 Their precious burden would thus be rapidly diffused among the 
 wealthier towns (notably Oualata), and but a costly fraction of it 
 would reach the banks of the Niger. 
 
 Jenne would therefore take especial pains to assure a regular 
 salt-market from which she could provide herself with large 
 quantities at a fair price. This would naturally lead her to the 
 discovery of the admirable geographical position of Timbuctoo, 
 which was situated at the very doors of the Mali people and on 
 the confines of her frontier. Caravans could go there direct from 
 the mines, and the merchandise be secured at first hand; Jenne's 
 great vessels, her most valuable auxiliaries, would now enter upon 
 the scene, and the new market would thus be established. 
 
 Timbuctoo (as we shall see later) could hardly be said to 
 exist until the merchants of Jenne settled there, and brought all 
 that the wealth of the Sudan could offer to the indigent starve- 
 lings of the desert in exchange for their loads of salt. The traders 
 of Morocco and Tuat followed in her train, and in this way 
 Jenne, although she did not actually create, undoubtedly founded 
 Timbuctoo, for she was the means of transforming the poor 
 hamlet into a great commercial centre of universal renown. 
 
 The Sudanese express this idea in their saying : ' Jenne and 
 Timbuctoo are two halves of the same city; 1 It is, in fact, a 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 171 
 
 portion of Jenne that lies out there on the threshold of the 
 desert ; her great merchants have homes and agents in the town, 
 and during several months of the year they personally direct 
 operations there. But in spite of this, the parts played in the 
 Sudanese commerce by these two halves are in no way homo- 
 geneous. Jenne's is the active, preponderating, and most interest- 
 ing share ; she represents the producer, the great merchant who 
 settles in the centre of a country to utilise all its powers and 
 resources. The character of Timbuctoo, on the other hand, is 
 passive ; she is the counting-house, the branch, a mere depot. 
 Her inhabitants are brokers, intermediaries, and innkeepers, and 
 she has always been inferior to Jenne both in wealth and com- 
 mercial importance. This is why the old chronicle speaks of 
 Jenne, and not Timbuctoo, as being one of the most considerable 
 towns of Islam, adding, ' It is on account of the blessed city of 
 Jenne that men come to Timbuctoo from all sides."* 
 
 How comes it, then, that Timbuctoo has acquired notoriety 
 all over the world while Jenne has remained comparatively 
 unknown ? The distinct characters of the two towns will explain 
 this injustice. The caravans of North Africa, Morocco, Tuat, 
 and Tripoli, which made the renown of Timbuctoo, never went 
 beyond that city, and knew nothing of the Western Sudan. 
 They had no need to prolong their journey into the south so 
 long as Timbuctoo offered in great quantities all the merchandise 
 they had come to seek. Even if it had occurred to the more 
 enlightened among them that they would obtain these goods at 
 cheaper rates in the country of their production, the paths thither 
 were encumbered by considerable difficulties. 
 
 Nature, in creating, at the immediate south of Timbuctoo, a 
 land that was a network of tributaries and channels and was 
 periodically submerged, had closed the doors of the Sudan 
 
172 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 against the caravans of northern Africa. Their camels, admir- 
 ably adapted to the passage of the desert, would have been 
 totally useless in such a country, and would soon have perished 
 from the excessive moisture. The north, therefore (at that time 
 Europe's sole source of information concerning the interior), 
 totally ignored the Sudan proper ; they only knew, and could 
 only know, Timbuctoo. This crushing preponderance is far from 
 obtaining in the Sudan, however, where the name of Jenne is 
 known to every one, while Timbuctoo is frequently ignored. 
 
 The renown of the Songhoi town extends to the Kong country 
 in the south, and to the Atlantic Ocean in the west. She sends 
 merchandise to the sea-coast ; and when the first Europeans 
 trading between Banin and Cape Palmas asked where the gold 
 and produce offered them for sale came from, the natives 
 answered ' from Jenne."* Her name was thus given to the Gulf 
 of Guinea, and, indirectly, to an English coin, the guinea, so 
 called because the first pieces were struck from gold coming 
 from there. 
 
 Of all the great cities of the Niger, Jenne was the one to 
 suffer least from the long period of anarchy that the history of 
 the Sudan has revealed to us. Signs of violence are not visible 
 at first sight as they are at Nyamina and Sansanding. It was, 
 nevertheless, cruelly used under the Toucouleur dominion. ' We 
 suffered nothing but vexation and pillage, 1 an old chief told me. 
 4 El Hadj Omar was a brigand, and his sons and generals have 
 carried on his trade. Little by little the town has been emptied 
 of its original inhabitants. Thou wilt find more of the people 
 of Jenne in the surrounding country than in the city itself. It 
 was time for the French to come. Colonel Archinard has done very 
 wisely. When he came before our walls he respected the merchant 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 173 
 
 
 quarter, and bombarded only that Toucouleur citadel which is 
 now your fort. 
 
 ' I will not disguise from thee that, in spite of all we suffered 
 from the Toucouleurs, the arrival of your people was disagreeable 
 to us. The Toucou- 
 leurs were at least 
 Mussulmans, and we 
 were afraid of the 
 dominion of the 
 Christian. We had 
 been told of many 
 misdeeds committed 
 by you. But now 
 we are very satisfied. 
 You allow us to 
 make our prayers, 
 and you do not 
 despoil us as the 
 Toucouleurs did, nor 
 do you force im- 
 pious practices upon 
 us, and make us eat 
 and drink unclean 
 things, as we were 
 told you would. 
 When you have col- 
 lected the tax you do not demand more, and you pay for all 
 you want. We can resume our trades in safety and with greater 
 profit, for the three tolls we had to pay upon the Niger before 
 reaching Timbuctoo have been removed. This is why the former 
 inhabitants are returning to us from all sides."

 In fact, during my stay there many old houses became re- 
 inhabited and new ones were built, and these latter afforded me 
 the opportunity of observing those Songhoi methods of construc- 
 tion which had been brought from so far, and were so different 
 from those I had hitherto noticed among the negroes. The 
 general physiognomy of the town is not less striking. Its 
 thresholds are no longer encumbered by sleepers and idlers, nor 
 are its streets obstructed by loafers, as is the custom elsewhere. 
 A bright energy and an unusual gaiety and elasticity of move- 
 ment are astir in the town from early morning. The people 
 hurry busily about, driving donkeys and carrying burdens, and all 
 are working to attain some end. I must admit that all this 
 
 MARKET IN THE STREETS 
 
 energy is only relative. In Paris or London I should call it 
 indolence, but in the Black Continent, under a blazing sun, it does

 not do to be too particular. The precincts of the great merchanjb 
 dwellings are particularly busy, their doors being literally besieged. 
 A crowd of clients, in the Roman and commercial sense of the 
 word, are awaiting their turn of audience. Some fill the streets 
 
 with a sound of noisy discussion, 
 while others, preoccupied by 
 their affairs, medita- 
 tively crack 
 and peel

 kola-nuts. Here and there in front of the eastern rampart, where 
 the bank slopes gently to the commercial gate, slaves load and un- 
 load the vessels which are incessantly coming and going. At the 
 four cross-roads you see low straw huts (the improvised stalls of 
 the itinerant vendor) looking conspicuously out of harmony with 
 the large houses. A few women keep a stall before their door ; 
 sometimes they leave their goods with piles of cowries beside them 
 indicating the prices, while they themselves are busy about the 
 house. Thus, instead of confining her trade to the market-place, 
 as is the case in other towns, Jenne cries c Commerce ! commerce ! ' 
 at every step of the way.

 The market does not present the accustomed haphazard 
 appearance of its negro counterpart, with merchandise strewn 
 about here, there, and everywhere. It occupies a large square in 
 the centre of the town, and is regularly intersected with paths 
 
 
 WOMEN 
 SELLING IN THE STREETS 
 
 for the buyers and raised places for the sellers. Rows of shops 
 border three of its sides, and the fourth opens upon the Mosque, 
 as if in reminder that honesty and good faith should preside 
 over all its transactions. Sitting surrounded by calabashes and 
 potteries, the women sell vegetables, milk, fish, animal butter (salt 
 or fresh), karita, spices, soap, and faggots of wood. There are 
 three erections formed by square posts in the centre of the market- 
 place, with a shop between every two posts, in which men 
 sell the choicer goods native and European textiles principally, 
 with salt, kola-nuts, slippers, boxes of matches, mirrors, pearls, 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 179 
 
 knives, etc. The money-changer is stationed here also, with his 
 black face showing out from between little mountains of cowries. 
 For native gold (in rings like the moneys of the Pharaohs) and 
 silver coins, varying from five-franc pieces to fifty centimes, he 
 gives and takes hundreds and thousands of these little shells. 
 Our gold pieces are not rated, because well, because they are 
 not very well known there just yet. 
 
 The butchers 1 shops are the most characteristic and picturesque 
 of all. Dead shrubs, retaining only their principal branches, are 
 planted before the posts, and the joints of meat are suspended 
 from them, while live sheep await their turn of cutlets and chops. 
 Primitive furnaces are established in their near neighbourhood, 
 upon which you may roast your purchase free of charge, if you buy 
 your fuel from the wood-seller next door. It is just like a 
 London grill-room ; but instead of the heavy atmosphere r and

 gloom peculiar to the taverns of that city, there is the vast sky 
 for ceiling, the brilliant sun for light, the bright and beautiful 
 decoration of an ancient Egyptian town for background, and a 
 
180 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 THE MONEY-CHANGER 
 
 crowd of people clothed in the white draperies of the Songhois 
 for surroundings. 
 
 Islamism and Arabian civilisation have been superimposed and 
 so firmly planted in these countries that a great many Egyptian 
 manners and customs have disappeared. The embalming of the 
 dead bodies of their celebrities (one of the most marked charac- 
 teristics of the peoples of the Nile) is no longer practised. The 
 Mohammedan religion considered the practice impious, but the 
 custom survived among the Songhois for a long time, nevertheless. 
 The old chronicles tell us concerning Ali the Conqueror : ' The 
 king being dead, his children caused him to be opened and the 
 entrails were taken out and replaced by honey, in order that the 
 body should not become corrupt. 1 Unfortunately their docu- 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 181 
 
 ments do not shed as much light upon other subjects. Nothing 
 recalls the ancient hieroglyphic or demotic characters. It is true 
 that thin pieces of a very smooth wood are used instead of paper 
 (which is expensive), to teach writing to the school-children. The 
 Pharaohic scribes were wont to employ the same materials, in order 
 to economise the more costly papyrus. The Arabic writing has 
 entirely obliterated the other, as it has in Egypt, and, for that 
 matter, as the Koran and Arabian jurist have effaced the native 
 judicial customs. 
 
 But you have only to enter their houses, and penetrate their 
 private life, to find in manners and customs many very char- 
 acteristic indications of their origin. Their oral traditions, 
 their chronicles, and their dwellings all betray their Nilotic 
 fatherland. The Songhois resemble a palimpsest on which the 
 
 THE BUTCHER 
 
 first manuscript is dimly decipherable. Fragments are, and 
 always will be, missing, but the omissions are those which it is 
 easy to supply. 
 
 Among the favourite divinities of ancient Egypt, the crocodile 
 
182 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 was especially dear to the priests of Thebes and Crocodilopolis, and 
 the cult is still to be found at Jenne under a form naturally 
 attenuated. The town and its environs are frequented by

 enormous green iguanas very similar to crocodiles. In Senegal 
 and elsewhere the natives hunt this saurian for the sake of its flesh, 
 which is very fine and delicate so I am told. The people of 
 Jenne, on the other hand, consider it sacred, and to kill it is to 
 commit sacrilege. ' The Koran does not forbid its meat,' replied 
 the marabuts to whom I reported this custom of the negroes, ' but 
 we venerate the iguanas because our fathers did so. 1 
 
 The dove, the oracular bird of the temple of Ammon, enjoys 
 similar privileges at Jenne ; nests and food are arranged for them 
 in the houses, and they are never by any chance put upon the 
 spit. The respect paid to the dove by these people is known of 
 in Nigerian countries other than Songhoi, where they are called 
 4 birds of Jenne. 1 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 183 
 
 The same ready sweetness of disposition that has already been 
 ascribed to the Egyptian races forms the psychological basis of the 
 Songhoi character. The chronicler of the Tarik, a man of the 
 Sudan but not of this race, has been struck by this. * The 
 characteristics of its inhabitants, 1 he says, ' are sympathy, kindness, 
 and generosity. ' They gave me an impression of that goodness 
 and spirit of charity with which the old Egyptian papyri are so 
 strongly imbued. The following was the happy altruism of the 
 old Jenne merchant who said to me (explaining the system of 
 their commission agents) : 4 We trust our merchandise to people 
 who have no goods ; they sell it for us throughout the country, 
 and part of the profit is theirs. If they have the will they 
 can become merchants in their turn/ And he concluded, ' It is 
 a disgrace to beg here, for among us it is possible for every one 
 
 JENNE : 
 THE HAIRDRESSER 
 
184 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 to earn a living. However poor he may be, a man has but to 
 work to become rich/ 
 
 We will now pass to more commonplace comparisons. Con- 
 trary to Oriental and Arab usage, but conformably with ancient 
 Egyptian custom, it is the men among the Songhois who weave 
 the textiles, and not the women. The latter do the spinning and 
 dyeing. Moreover, the Nigerian negro knows only one colour, the 
 blue of his indigo, but the Songhoi uses black, yellow, and copper- 
 red vegetable dyes. The ornamental motives employed are 
 severely symmetrical, the most frequently used being that alterna- 
 tion of dark and light squares so often found in the hangings and 
 draperies of the Egyptian frescoes. Among their finer tissues one 
 deserves special attention ; it is a luxurious stuff, used for shawls or 
 turbans, and woven with an uneven surface resembling our honey- 
 combed towelling. 
 
 Among the artisans we can trace vestiges of a division into 
 companies. Masons and blacksmiths alike are furnished by certain 
 families, the trades descending from father to son. Both occupa- 
 tions recognise the supreme authority of one of their number, 
 who takes his place among those personages of the town who 
 deliberate and control public affairs. Masonry is man's work 
 here, while in the negro countries it is the women who build the 
 houses. 
 
 While Senegalese and Sudanese lean towards blue as the pre- 
 vailing tint of their garments, the Songhois show a preference for 
 white, like the Nubians ; and rice, not millet, is their staple food. 
 Their kuss-kuss is not taken from calabashes, but is served in cups 
 of baked clay similar in every point to those in the scenes of 
 repast depicted upon the Egyptian tombs. The various forms of 
 their numerous potteries also recall the antique specimens of the 
 same land ; and they have real wooden bedsteads instead of the 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 185 
 
 lump of earth, covered with skins, that serves the negro as a 
 place of repose. . . . 
 
 The last day at Jenne ! I have been employed since morning

 much hesitation, suspicion even. They could not understand 
 this European, the first they had ever seen, who was neither 
 soldier nor trader. My incessant and entirely unexpected ques- 
 tions bewildered them. They looked at one another and laughed 
 as the interpreter transmitted them, and were obviously think- 
 ing, ' What absurd idea has the white man got into his head ? 
 What has all this got to do with him ? ' Then, hearing that their 
 most learned marabut was reading the Tarik to me, and that I 
 
186 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 gathered marabuts about me and blacked sheets of paper as I 
 listened to them, they began to classify me accordingly and called 
 me the ' marabiit-toubab ' (the white marabut), and the nick-name 
 soon became popular. By-and-by I became a subject of much 
 salutation in my walks abroad. The men greeted me in Arabian 
 fashion, with the right hand placed first to the forehead and 
 then to the heart ; the women with a gracious movement of 
 the left hand similar to the military salute. I did not deceive 
 myself, however ; these demonstrations merely expressed much 
 compassion and indulgence for a harmless lunatic, an inoffensive 
 imbecile, ' the man with the questions. 1 But when I could speak 
 with some knowledge of their ancestors, their epopee, and their 
 little anecdotes : ' Iho, iho ' (ah, ah !), they triumphantly exclaimed, 
 4 thou wilt write a Tarik for the whites about the blacks ! ' After 
 this they lent me their books willingly enough, and opened their 
 doors to me, even introducing me to the women's apartments. 
 Thus the monomaniac became, bit by bit, more than a mere 
 acquaintance, and an indulgent contempt was exchanged for a 
 real affection. Their farewell visits (entirely unexpected) revealed 
 this to me, and I discovered that I too had a feeling for some of 
 them which was more than sympathy. They all brought some 
 offering, a small souvenir, a few provisions, and little notes in 
 Arabic, representing letters of introduction. Kindly wishes for 
 the journey were mingled with affectionate questions: 'Would I 
 come and see them again ? ' ' Should we talk together once more 
 of Dialliaman, the impious Sunni Ali, and the unhappy old age of 
 Askia the Great ? " In order to j ustify my reputation of ' marabut- 
 toubab, 1 I said to them : ' Yes, we shall all meet again. Not here, 
 but in a country where there are neither blacks nor whites, in the 
 land of Allah, where you will be white like me.'' Whereat we all 
 laughed together for the last time. 
 
JENNE YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY 187 
 
 Towards the end of the afternoon, as the hour of the prayer 
 that must be said at sunset approaches, they all withdraw, and I 
 go up to the terrace of my house. From that height the town, 
 the island, and the three channels that join to sever Jenne from 
 the mainland, look as though drawn upon a map. After having 
 pressed the hands of its friendly inhabitants, I wish to take a 
 last look at this country which has so impressed itself upon my 
 imagination. 
 
 The plain is scattered with white dots like daisies, but they are 
 moving daisies, all possessed by the same motive and all drawn 
 towards the town as to the sun. On the banks of the river the 
 white dots collect in groups ; they are the people hastening to 
 their houses at the close of day, and waiting for the canoe ferry- 
 boat to take them over the water. Dark spots now appear in the 
 distance making for the same point ; they are troops of horses 
 returning from pasture. They wait for no ferry-boat, but pre- 
 cipitate themselves into the water that separates them from their 
 stables. Finding no one waiting for them at the gates, they 
 gallop through the town, joyously chasing, kicking, and nibbling 
 each other. The streets are filled with a delightful uproar, cries, 
 laughter, and swirling movements of voluminous white draperies 
 as the foot-passengers start aside from the frolicsome animals. 
 When the latter have had their play out, they go peaceably home 
 in search of the masters who have given themselves no trouble to 
 look for their beasts. 
 
 All sounds gradually die away in the town. A marabut has 
 climbed to the terrace of the great mosque, and cries, 'God is 
 great ! ' The surrounding terraces are peopled with white forms, 
 which stand out against the summits of the palm-trees and the 
 green of the baobab. Their backs are turned to the purple 
 splendours of the dying light, for their faces look towards the 
 
188 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 already darkened east, which is lighted for them by that eternal 
 light in which Mecca is to be found. 
 
 The silence is harshly broken by a brazen sound ; it is the bugle 
 from the fort sounding the call for rations. . . . 
 
 The plain is now a vast desert, phantasmagorically illuminated. 
 Above, the sky flames into every imaginable colour, and the 
 channels, scarcely visible a moment ago, blaze into a reflection 
 of the ardour of the sky, while the rows of ospreys upon their 
 banks look like necklaces of pink pearls. Then all the enchant- 
 ment is overwhelmed in the sudden darkness of a tropical night. 
 
 Farewell, my friends, whose lips are murmuring prayers un- 
 known to mine ! Farewell, strange island ! Farewell, mother of 
 Timbuctoo, thou Egyptian Jenne to whom I owe the unimagin- 
 able joy of having lived, at the end of the nineteenth century, in 
 a city of the Pharaohs ! 
 
CHAPTER IX 
 
 FROM JENNE TO TIMBUCTOO 
 
 RE-INSTALLED in my yacht-canoe, I followed the accustomed path 
 of the Niger in order to reach Timbuctoo. I hastened towards 
 the mysterious city, hoping to find the sequel to that epoch of 
 civilisation of which Jenne had accounted for the first half. I 
 longed to raise completely the veil which has hidden the Sudan 
 from us for so long, and caused us to look upon that country as 
 the last refuge of barbarity, which was in reality an offshoot of 
 the great Egyptian tree, the father of all western civilisation. 
 
 Tara, tara, Bosos ! give way, my brave fellows ! What a life 
 that was during those seven days ! We journeyed day and night, 
 and I did not get two hours' consecutive sleep the whole time. To 
 find one's way across the three deltas lying between Jenne and 
 Timbuctoo is no easy task. I was obliged to navigate my little 
 craft with compass in one hand and chart in the other, like a 
 captain crossing the ocean. An ocean this country veritably is in 
 January. When the floods are at their height, it becomes a 
 region of navigable verdure, a labyrinth which extends a bewilder- 
 ing network of meandering tributaries, creeks, and channels along 
 the course of the river. My imperfect chart and hastily recruited, 
 inexperienced crew demanded an untiring vigilance. No moon ! 
 and the vague light of the stars only served to assist our 
 digressions. One night in particular has left behind it the memory 
 
FROM JENNE TO TIMBUCTOO 191 
 
 of an agonising nightmare. I was in the neighbourhood of El 
 Oual Hadj, where two branches of the Niger, joining in one bed, 
 form a small archipelago by their union. Entering this seed-plot 
 of islands in the pitch darkness, I wandered about and up and 
 down to such good purpose, that it was daylight before I succeeded 
 in getting clear of them. The entire night was spent in wander- 
 ing backwards and forwards in utter darkness. Every moment I 
 thought I had at last found an opening, only to be confronted by 
 another island. I seemed imprisoned in a labyrinth. . . . You 
 know the anecdote of the tipsy man who guided his staggering 
 steps by means of the railing of a monument, and ended by think- 
 ing he had been locked up ? Allowing for an absence of wine 
 and the presence of a great deal too much water, my sensations 
 were precisely similar. 
 
 In seven days' time we had cleared the region of the deltas, an 
 actual distance of three geographical degrees ; but, what with its 
 bends and windings, we had made at least 311 miles of it. In the 
 course of these miles I had watched landscapes from Normandy 
 and scenes from Syria unfold before my moving dwelling. I had 
 seen the ports of Korienza, Sarafara, and Dara-Salam, which unite 
 with Jenne in supplying the markets of Timbuctoo, and I had 
 passed, and met, many of those delightful ' Jenne boats. 1 They were 
 sometimes solitary, sometimes in fleets of ten or fourteen, accord- 
 ing to the old-time custom, when numbers were their only pro- 
 tection against the pirates of the Niger. I enjoyed a picturesque 
 glimpse of one of these little fleets one evening. The boats were 
 anchored in the shelter of a small creek, and the crews were camp- 
 ing out round the great fires they had lighted on the banks ; they 
 reminded me of the Phoenicians trading and living thus upon the 
 shores of the Mediterranean. 
 
 Only two fortifications are set up on our route, viz. Sarafara 
 
FROM JENNE TO TIMBUCTOO 193 
 
 and El Oual Hadj, both being so entirely different from any I had 
 seen before that they deserve mention. It is only a year since we 
 set foot in this region (lately the scene of Touareg pillage and 
 exploitation), and it is easily understood that these posts (being 
 valuable strategic points) are not simple centres of surveillance and 
 administration, but have retained the character of forts. The 
 gleam of bayonets is visible at some distance, and look-outs are 
 posted on high places to keep watch on the horizon. 
 
 The military aspect of El Oual Hadj is particularly marked. 
 It is a pioneers' outpost, and was entirely constructed by a half- 
 company of Sudanese tirailleurs. On an artificial hillock, in a 
 clearing in the midst of palm-trees, two rows of sheds are set up. 
 The trees which were cut down to make the glade formed the sole 
 materials used for their construction. One row contains the 
 whites, officers and petty officers, and the other the blacks. The 
 embankment is surrounded by a palisade, clumps of dead thorn 
 are scattered about its slopes, while iron wires are stretched 
 across to guard against surprise. It has no walls or loopholes, its 
 very rough-and-ready intention being merely to guard against 
 surprise, and to permit the discharge of volleys of firing. Do you 
 care to know what the fort has cost the nation ? The formidable 
 sum of forty-nine francs fifteen centimes, inclusive of an admirable 
 mirador, from which the look-out signals suspicious arrivals by 
 water or land. 
 
 At some hundreds of feet from these fortifications, a solitary 
 hillock rises from the banks of the river. It is obviously an arti- 
 ficial eminence, and here and there are found scattered about the 
 bricks and stones which so puzzled Captain Philippe, the con- 
 structor of El Oual Hadj. The natives, upon being questioned, 
 yield the information that several similar mounds are to be 
 found on the left bank of the river, and a legend affirms that 
 
194 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 THE FORT OF EL OUAL HADJ 
 
 they were the dwellings, now fallen into ruins, of the chiefs 
 of old. 
 
 This is not my opinion. I believe them to represent the 
 tombs, and not the palaces, of these same chiefs. El Bekri, an 
 Arab who visited this country towards the middle of the eleventh 
 century, describes their funerals in these words : ' Upon the death 
 of a king these negroes construct a great wooden dome, which they 
 set up in the place appointed to be his grave. They then arrange 
 the body on a couch covered with stuffs and cushions, and set it 
 inside the dome. Beside the dead they place his ornaments, arms, 
 and the plates and cups from which he had eaten and drunken 
 during his lifetime. Different kinds of food and beverages are 
 also placed there, and they enclose with the monarch several of 
 his cooks and the concoctors of royal drinks. The whole being 
 covered with mats and cloths, the people assemble and throw 
 earth upon the tomb until it forms a large hillock. These 
 negroes sacrifice victims to their dead, and bring them intoxi- 
 cating drinks as offerings." 
 
 Unfortunately, I was not able to ascertain if these mounds still 
 enclosed their ghastly remains. But better times are coming ; and 
 when the Touaregs are once more relegated to their real home, the 
 
FROM JENNE TO TIMBUCTOO 195 
 
 desert, I hope that among the commanders of El Oual Hadj one 
 will be found of a sufficiently enterprising turn of mind to claim 
 its secret from the little mound. 
 
 After Sarafara, in addition to its varied pictures, the river 
 offers the further interest of the enaction of one of Nature's 
 dramas the struggle between the Niger and the Sahara, the 
 battle of life against death. The rebuffs the giant river offers to 
 the sand are plainly visible. The blows he has given are marked 
 by patches of green meadows, stretches of cultivation, rice-fields 
 and trees ; those he has received shine and quiver in sandy white- 
 ness under the brilliant sun. Across the vegetation the enemy 
 traces now and again a path which dies abruptly on approaching 
 the river-banks. The spectator is warned ; the dominion of the 
 waters is about to cease and the kingdom of the desert is at 
 hand. 
 
 The Niger weakens as it draws nearer to Timbuctoo, and in- 
 stead of pursuing its triumphant progress towards the north it 
 gradually diverges to the east. The sands redouble their attack. 
 Upon the left bank their masses grow in size and increase in 
 numbers; and they follow the giant watchfully, approaching as 
 they see his powers fail. 
 
 The last act of the drama takes place near Timbuctoo, where 
 the Niger, finally resolved to yield the north to the desert, turns 
 abruptly to the east and retires in the direction of Lake Chad. 
 It is not a flight but a retreat, and he withdraws with all the 
 honours of war, detaching a great arm to protect his rear. This 
 arm, the Pool of Dai, offers a last resistance to the dunes. So 
 valiantly does it defend the retreat of the river that we find it 
 advancing into the midst of the sand, and its waters appear under 
 the walls of Timbuctoo itself. 
 
196 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 The kingdom of the sands is now our goal, for the famous 
 town stands at its very gates. The river may pursue the dawn ;

 we will part from him here and direct our steps towards the Pool 
 of Dai. This month of January marks the highest moment of 
 flood, and the waters carry their weeds right up to the foot of the 
 
FROM JENNE TO TIMBUCTOO 
 
 197 
 
 dunes. A vast yellow-green expanse spreads to the distant fringe 
 of trees that indicate terra Jirma. This border is abruptly broken 
 as we advance, and a sandhill larger and whiter than any we have 
 seen before is unmasked, dominating the horizon and arrogantly 
 proclaiming the victory of the desert. It has reason to be proud, 
 for directly behind it lies Timbuctoo. 
 
 Kabara, however, the landing-place and fort of Timbuctoo, is 
 not there, but further away upon the horizon, where that round 
 dark mass emerges. We make for it in a direct line, abandoning 
 the pool to cut straight across the navigable green. As my boat 
 advances, another sandy height appears beside the distant mass, 
 and slowly defines itself into a square mass of walls. At one 
 extremity a flag is floating (the fort, doubtless), and at the 
 other, clearly cut against the sky, spread the sinister arms of a 
 tall black cross. Below this strange apparition square earthen 
 houses and round straw huts cover the sloping banks. It is 
 Kabara. 
 
 THE ARRIVAL AT KABARA 
 
198 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 We have now reached a basin of water in which a fleet of 
 4 Jenne boats ' are lying at anchor. The buzz of humanity rises 
 from its large quay, and all the amusing bustle of a harbour reigns 
 
 THE QUAYS OF KABARA 
 
 there. In miniature certainly. The port of Timbuctoo is a mere 
 toy in comparison with Havre or Marseilles, but the first impres- 
 sion is the same. 
 
 We are no sooner disembarked than my attention is arrested 
 by two things which stay by me until my departure, viz. the sand 
 and the Touaregs. The sand, because you have no sooner set 
 your foot on shore than you flounder about in it as if it were 
 a mire, and it pursues you everywhere, in the country, in the 
 streets, and in the houses. 
 
 The Touaregs are impressed upon you, because, though you 
 never see them, everything recalls them. You notice the un- 
 
FROM JENNE TO TIMBUCTOO 
 
 199 
 
 accustomed luxury of sentinels posted about the approaches to the 
 fort, and that its usual garrison of infantry is supplemented by 
 cavalry and several cannon. All are still on the alert, although a 
 year has expired since our occupation. The stern lesson of the 
 Bonnier disaster has been taken to heart, a lesson which has 
 been recently enforced by the not less tragic episode of the 
 massacre of the midshipman Aube, at a place some few miles 
 distant from the fort. His gunboat was anchored at the foot of 
 the green mound, and, being attacked by the veiled men of the 
 desert, he allowed a rash pursuit of them to draw him into the 
 midst of the sands. The foolhardy young man and his nineteen 
 companions now lie on the crest of the hill under the great cross 
 which stretches its arms towards the serenity of the sky. 
 
 Kabara, like Segu and Sansanding, suffered cruelly under the 
 
 KABARA : THE GRAVES OF THE AUBE EXPEDITION 
 
 prolonged anarchy which reigned in the valley of the Niger, and her 
 misery was further aggravated by the exactions of the Touaregs. 
 The town is in ruins, but for all that the dominant impression is 
 
200 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 not one of poverty. The wretchedness of the town itself is over- 
 powered by the life and movement it encloses. The quays are 
 astir with lively bustle, and encumbered with bales, jars, and sacks 
 in the process of loading or unloading. Boatmen and passengers 
 economically camp out in parties everywhere. 
 
 ON THE QUAYS OF KABARA 
 
 Through the streets stream a perpetual coming and going of 
 dock-labourers, donkeys and camels, convoys arriving from Tim- 
 buctoo in search of merchandise, and nomads from the desert 
 bringing their cattle in exchange for fresh provisions. These 
 two figures may help to give precision to the details : with 
 twelve hundred settled inhabitants, the town contains a floating 
 population of a thousand strangers. 
 
 Kabara is not the only port of Timbuctoo. She shares the 
 honour with two others, being herself only able to play the part 
 during a limited period (November to March) of each year. When 
 the waters are at their maximum (in January) they encroach upon 
 and follow the course of two depressions at the extremity of the 
 dune of Kabara, passing behind it and penetrating some six or 
 eight miles into the midst of the sands. One of these branches, 
 the smallest, turns to the west and is navigable. It is called the 
 Pool of Kabara, and they say that in years of unusual inundation 
 
UNIVL.RiL.fTY 
 
 OF 
 
 FROM JENNE TO TIMBUCTOO 
 
 201 
 
 (such as in 1894) large boats of thirty tons can go, by its means, 
 right up to the gates of the town. Otherwise their cargoes have 
 to be considerably lightened, but, for six weeks or so, canoe lighters 
 ply regularly between Kabara and Timbuctoo by means of this 
 pool. 
 
 The level of the Niger being considerably lowered in April, the 
 great plain of navigable grass dries up and becomes a stretch of 
 cultivation which reaches to the quays of Kabara; and the town, 
 ceasing to be a harbour, becomes an agricultural centre. 
 
 From April to June the great boats stop at Dai, two and a 
 half miles from Kabara, and canoes carry the cargoes between the 
 two places by means of a small canal. Later on, in July, the 
 vessels are stopped at Koriouma-Djitafa, situated upon the Niger 
 itself at a distance of six miles from Kabara. 
 
 Timbuctoo has therefore three ports, the inconvenience of 
 which did not fail to attract the attention of Askia the Great 
 
 when he concentrated his fleet at Kabara. He it was who cut the 
 canal from Dai to Kabara, and at that time it probably assured 
 the permanent circulation of lighters and made Kabara the sole 
 port, Dai and Koriouma being relegated to the position of mere 
 
202 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 places of trans-shipment. The canal has silted up now, however, 
 and is useless at the fall of the river. 
 
 Timbuctoo is only separated from Kabara by five miles of over- 
 land route, and I could have reached the mysterious town a few 
 hours after landing at its port. But I was in need of rest to 
 restore my mental balance before I could quietly, sanely, and fully 
 enjoy the sight of the town that I had travelled all these miles to 
 behold. To see Timbuctoo ! I had dreamed of it as a schoolboy, 
 and now my dream was about to be realised. I determined to be 
 epicurean, and rush into no rash gluttony. They tell me I can 
 
 I 
 
 THE FORT OF KABARA 
 
 see the town from the height of the fort, but I will not go. I wish 
 to taste, the first impression in its entirety, without destroying its 
 bloom by a bird's-eye view. 
 
.FROM JENNE TO TIMBUCTOO 203 
 
 One afternoon I bestride a first-rate mule, a regular walking 
 arm-chair, and my traps augment the humps of several camels. 
 Three o'clock. A bugle sounds, and the town shakes off its drowsi- 
 
 THE CONVOY 
 
 ness. A medley of people, donkeys and camels, stream towards 
 the little parade in front of the fort, while from it emerges a 
 picket of twenty tirailleurs with rifles on their shoulders. 
 
 It is the hour of departure for the daily convoy. These few 
 five miles of road are not to be traversed at will, as are the three 
 hundred separating Kayes from the Niger. We are obliged to 
 travel under escort here, for, short as it is, the road is not safe. 
 You divine the reason ? Touaregs always. Only ten days ago 
 these brigands attacked some solitary travellers, and duly pillaged 
 and killed them. 
 
 6 To the front for the Sahara ! ' The crowd for Timbuctoo 
 advances. Each one carries or drives something. Children worry 
 unfortunate little asses, which are so loaded that only their ears 
 are visible, and they look for all the world like walking bundles. 
 Men armed with spears and guns accompany the camels, and 
 women, placidly smoking their long pipes, are perched upon 
 
204 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 small donkeys, with their screaming progeny on the crupper. 
 The whole thing has less the effect of a caravan than of the 
 
 emigration of an armed people carrying the very uttermost of 
 their household goods with them. 
 
 The borders of the desert were a surprise to me, for I had 
 fully expected to find them a sudden expanse of bare, shining 
 sand. Nature^s moods are not so abrupt, however ; she prepares 
 a transition. We are in the midst of hot, soft sand certainly, 
 but it is not bare. Only the road, or rather track, is of the 
 expected shining whiteness. The rest is covered with a peculiar 
 vegetation which is neither wood nor thicket. It is a dwarf forest 
 containing a rickety growth of scrubby palms, mimosas, and gum 
 acacias. They are a pale, dusty colour, an anaemic green, with 
 such trivial branches and leaves that the shade they give is 
 anaemic too, the phantom shade of a phantom forest. 
 
 The watercourse which we meet and meet again, and yet a 
 
FROM JENNE TO TIMBUCTOO 
 
 205 
 
 third time, is equally unexpected. Water in the desert! It is 
 the Pool of Kabara on its devious way to Timbuctoo. God be 
 praised, they have not yet made a bridge across it. Imagine the 
 Sahara with bridges ! The water cuts straight across the track, 
 and escort and escorted have to ford it, to the great joy of the 
 spectator. 
 
 The water is fully breast high. The tirailleurs carefully 
 remove their uniforms, and the men take off their ample draperies ; 
 so do the women, but they imperturbably retain their pipes. 
 They carry their most precious possessions, arms, clothes, and 
 goods, on their heads. It is now the turn of the animals, and 
 the donkeys make the most ridiculous scenes. As soon as the 
 water has 'so shallowed that swimming is unnecessary, they sit 
 down in it, apparently bent on suicide. Indescribable barbarities 
 now take place. Men, women, and children fling themselves upon 
 an unfortunate animal. One seizes it by the ears, another by 
 the legs, and a great many by the tail (the lever par excellence 
 on these occasions). The animal calmly allows itself to be drawn 
 to the bank, while its zealous rescuers charge into the absent- 
 minded, and cause many an involuntary bath. 
 
 FORDING THE STREAM ON THE WAY TO TIMBUCTOO 
 
206 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 I pictured a party of Touaregs arriving in the midst of this 
 hubbub. Right and left of the track the undulating ground and 
 scrubby thicket could well mask a surprise, and equally well cover 
 a retreat, the attack being once made. 
 
 The road half-way between Kabara and Timbuctoo bears a 
 sinister reputation. The natives have given it the tragic name 
 'Our* 1 Oumaira'' (They hear not), meaning that neither at Tim- 
 buctoo nor Kabara can the cries of the victims be heard. The 
 
 'OUR' OUMAIRA' 
 
 place has bitter memories for us also. A cross, sister to the one 
 that gloomily dominates Kabara, is set up in one of these valleys. 
 
FROM JENNE TO TIMBUCTOO 
 
 207 
 
 A little leather placard is nailed to it, bearing the following 
 inscription : 
 
 After reading this inscription one casts suspicious glances right 
 and left into the undulating and woody landscape. A little 
 prudence is decidedly advisable. This preoccupation is so increased 
 by the uproar of the picturesque medley of people crowding round 
 the escort like chickens round a hen, that the thought of the 
 approaching vision of the town is forgotten. 
 
 At a given moment, however, the mass gathered round the 
 escort opens out, the track rises to climb a bare dune, and when 
 we have followed it to the top Timbuctoo is spread before 
 our eyes. 
 
DISTANT VIEW 
 
 CHAPTER X 
 
 TIMBUCTOO x 
 
 AN immense and brilliant sky, and an immense and brilliant 
 stretch of land, with the grand outlines of a town uniting the 
 two. A dark silhouette, large and long, an image of grandeur in 
 immensity, thus appeared the Queen of the Sudan. 
 
 Across the space everything looks simple and severe ; the 
 
 1 The native pronunciation is more nearly represented by the orthography 
 Tomboutou. 
 
OF TIMBUCTOO 
 
 forest is dwarfed out of sight, and nothing diminishes the vast 
 landscape, which is lighted by the throbbing glare of the veritable 
 sun of the desert. 
 
 Truly she is enthroned upon the horizon with the majesty of 
 a queen. She is indeed the city of imagination, the Timbuctoo 
 of European legend. 
 
 Her sandy approaches are strewn with bones and carcasses that 
 have been disinterred by wild beasts, the remains of the camels, 
 horses, and donkeys that have fallen down and died in the last 
 stages of the journey. The cities of the East are invariably 
 encircled by their bones, and the roads across the desert are lined 
 by their bodies. 
 
 The details of the distant shape grow clearer by degrees. The 
 
 209 
 
210 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 illusion of walls, produced by the distinctness with which the town 
 stands out from the white sand, disappears, and three towers, 
 placed at regular intervals, dominate the mass. The terraces of 
 
 A STREET AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TOWN 
 
 square houses are now distinguishable, giving an appearance of 
 depth to the outlined mass, and renewing the first impression of 
 grandeur. 
 
 Whether you approach from the banks of the Niger, from the 
 shores of the Atlantic, by the Moroccan and Arawan routes, or 
 from the coasts of the Mediterranean by Tripoli or Ghadames, the 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 town presents the same outlines : fine, long and deep, and evoking 
 the same impression of grandeur in immensity. 
 
 / 
 
 We have entered the town, and, as behind the scenes of a 
 theatre, behold ! all the grandeur has suddenly disappeared. 
 
 It is another scene now, equally impressive, but on account 
 of its tragic character rather than its beauty. Instead of finding 
 the compact and well-ordered city which was promised us by the 
 exterior, we enter a town that seems to have recently passed 
 through the successive dramas of siege, capture, and destruc- 
 tion. 
 
 The foreground, to which the play of sun and shadow had 
 given the distant effect of city ramparts, proves to be a mass of 
 deserted houses. The roofs have fallen in, the doors are gone, 
 the walls are broken and crumbling, and have become mere heaps 
 of ruin. Piles of earth, bricks, and bits of wood are scattered over 
 the open spaces which were once the paths leading to these defunct 
 dwellings. 
 
 Beyond these ruins behold the market, or rather one of the 
 markets. This is the largest of them, I am told, and I begin to 
 hope that the sinister impression left by the entrance to the town 
 will now be removed. 
 
 The place is spacious, certainly, but is this the great market 
 of Timbuctoo ? These women with little baskets, little cala- 
 bashes, and little round mats, selling insignificant little things, red, 
 green, white, drab, and black, spices and vegetables, for infinitely 
 little sums of cowries, just as in any, no matter what, little 
 market in no matter what little town of the Sudan. Is this the 
 universal commerce of Timbuctoo PyyWhy, if I only recall the 
 market of Jenne, this is the most miserable in the world. And 
 I, who thought to find here a pendant to the great fairs of yester- 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 day or those of Nijni Novgorod of to-day ! I, who expected to 
 see heaps and heaps of the produce of Arabian Africa, Negraic 
 Africa, and Europe ! 
 
 Instead of obliterating the image of these ruins, this spectacle 
 bites it in more deeply .A What is passing here ? what has passed 
 here? I ask myself in disconcerted bewilderment. The houses 
 round the market-place have the appearance of being able to 
 stand, certainly, and are even inhabited, but, O my beautiful 
 dwellings of Jenne, how far away you seem T -Where are your 
 imposing forms atad harmonious outlines ? You would appear 
 monumental now. Here are merely houses of a kind, things 
 without character, height, or style. Just four walls and a flat 
 roof. If this mediocrity were only pleasingly clean ! But their 
 unburnt bricks are worn, crumbling, and cracked, under the com- 
 bined effects of rain, wind, and sun. Any attempt to keep 
 them repaired was given up long ago. They seem to have been 
 deserted for years and inhabited again quite recently. The 
 bizarre appearance of their enclosing walls seems to confirm this 
 hypothesis, for the breaches in them have been hastily stopped 
 with carelessly adjusted mats, bundles of straw, and fagots of 
 brushwood. 
 
 The further we advance the more the misery increases, and all 
 traces of the majestic exterior disappear. Only the sky is the 
 same, brilliant and immense. 
 
 Let us follow the road that buries itself in the heart of the 
 town. The buildings bordering it are rather higher here; they\ 
 even have an additional story. But indulgent as I am inclined to 
 be, I cannot deny that they also are threatened with ruin, and 
 that neglect is written on their walls in cracks and crevices. 
 Their second stories are still further advanced in disintegration, 
 and the bars of the little Moorish windows have fallen away.

 Only the doors and thresholds show any sign of care and habita- 
 tion. The former are curious, being very massive, garnished 
 
 
 
 
 A LARGE HOUSE 
 
 with a profusion of enormous-headed nails, and bound with iron 
 like a safe. They are all carefully shut, too, contrary to the 
 custom of negro countries. 
 
 Beyond this road (a comparatively sound spot), the leprous 
 patches reappear, and vague bits of ground (the sites of houses 
 which have been deserted or destroyed), mingle with poor 
 hovels enclosed by a heterogeneous collection of brushwood, 
 mats, and walls. The general wretchedness is occasionally varied 
 by groups of straw huts with fences of matting. They are 
 clusters of nomad Foulbe dwellings in the midst of the debris 
 of the town.

 / find an Athens, Rome, or Cairo here ; but straw huts ! not many 
 V of them, certainly, butin the very heart of the town. 
 \ Here and there I pass a few healthy islands of tall houses with 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 215 
 
 studded doors close shut ; then, more ruins. One of the latter 
 arrests my attention. Although it is a lamentable wreck, with 
 ceiling and roof hanging from a lacework of walls, its great size 
 indicates some dwelling of importance. A public building per- 
 haps. Who lived here ? It proved to be no ordinary house, 
 for the man who dwelt there was known all over Europe, all 
 over the world, and the Queen of England corresponded with 
 him. A man whom the learned and the explorers of every 
 country held in pious memory, BartlVs host and protector, Sheik 
 el Backay, lived here. Its crumbling walls have no other roof than 
 the sky. The family of one of his servants vegetates in a little 
 corner of the courtyard, into which some seedlings of the' cotton- 
 plant have thrust their way. This is all that remains of the once 
 brilliant life that held sway there. 
 
 THE STRAW HUTS, WITH STRAW ENCLOSURES 
 
 From one extremity of the town to the other the same story is 
 repeated of roads ill and dying. You sink in their sands as if you 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 were in the midst of the desert. A city in deliquescence, such is 
 the town which the sun had shown from afar as so majestically 
 great. 
 
 Have I been the sport of a mirage? The spectacle was so 
 unexpected and absorbing that I had hitherto paid no heed to 
 the life and movement stirring among these ruins, and had not 
 noticed their contrast with the fading town. But tall blue- 
 and-white forms are energetically stirring about the city, and 
 strings of heavily laden camels, donkeys, and porters encumber 
 the roads. I scarcely notice that all the idioms of the 
 Sahara, Sudan, and elsewhere, from the Mediterranean and 
 the Atlantic to Lake Chad, are to be heard here. I do not 
 distinguish, under white turban or red fez, all the different 
 types of the negro races, Arab, Berber, Songhoi, Mossi, 
 Bambara^ Toucouleur, Malinka, among the blacks ; and Foulbes, 
 Moors, Touaregs, and Tripolitans among the whites. This 
 human amalgam is miserably clad, and their untidy, ragged, 
 and dirty coats are so completely in harmony with their back- 
 
 TIMBUCTOO: A STREE1

 ground, that one confounds them with the ruins. The obstinately 
 closed doors would lead you to imagine that all these passers-by 
 are strangers to the town. 
 
 TIMBUCTOO : A CORNER OF THE TOWN 
 
 The impression is so profound that sight and judgment are 
 deceived, overthrown. It is not only the illusion of the distant 
 view, the vanished mirage, which embitters the deception, it is the 
 destruction of all that glamour which surrounded the name of 
 Timbuctoo in the mind of the European. The disillusion is 
 complete, for I know that the town has not been besieged, 
 pillaged, bombarded, nor destroyed since it was occupied by our 
 troops. Our flag was planted there some months back without 
 
218 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 a shot being fired. The town is precisely what it was before we 
 entered her. 
 
 /And this is the great Timbuctoo, the metropolis of the Sudan 
 /4nd the Sahara, with its boasted wealth and commerce. This is 
 Timbuctoo the holy, the learned, that light of the Niger, of which 
 it was written, ' We shall one day correct the texts of our Greek 
 and Latin classics by the manuscripts which are preserved there.' 
 And I have not even seen one of the open-air schools which were 
 so numerous at Jenne. 
 
 These ruins, this rubbish, this wreck of a town, is this the 
 secret of Timbuctoo the Mysterious ? 
 
 You can imagine my perplexity when it became time to think 
 of a lodging. My first thought was naturally to settle in the 
 road and pitch my tent in one of its empty spaces, at a respectful 
 and prudent distance from these falling houses, be it understood. 
 My servant, however, an old Senegalese tirailleur, who had fought 
 against Samory, and who was afraid of nothing, set out in quest of 
 an abode while I continued to explore the town. ' I have found a 
 house, 1 he cried on his return, and radiantly led me towards one 
 that was in every respect as deliquescent as the rest. 
 
 To my great surprise, however, the inside did not harmonise 
 with its exterior. It was no palace, but it was fresh and clean, 
 and in good condition, truly regal in contrast with the outside 
 sights. I decided upon it at once, and found the habitation com- 
 prised two rooms, a vestibule, and an ante-room to a court, which 
 was about as large as a couple of linen sheets. Three rooms (the 
 apartments proper) opened from these. A passage led to a court 
 of vague locality somewhere at the back, and a little staircase gave 
 access to the roof. The whole was let for twenty-five francs a 
 month. 
 
TIMBUCTOO 219 
 
 The camels grunting at the door were immediately unloaded, 
 and I contemplated my traps with emotion. A moment ago I 
 thought there was not a whole thing in Timbuctoo, in the world 
 even. The sight of my packages dispelled this nightmare. In a 
 regular fever I insisted upon unpacking them myself. I set up the 
 camp-bedstead, my table and folding-chair, my pots and pans, my 
 tub and my toothbrush, and then I contemplated them all with a 
 childish joy, not unmixed with tears, for all these things were not 
 cracked, crumbling, and falling into ruins. 
 
 Next morning I sent round the letters of recommendation pro- 
 vided by my friends in Jcnne. The little pieces of paper were 
 filled with warm words, and very soon rows of slippers on the 
 threshold of my dwelling announced the presence of numerous 
 visitors within. My house was filled with welcoming presents, 
 eggs, dates, ostrich-plumes, hens, chickens, and sheep. I was 
 compelled to sacrifice the latter, as pasturage was not included in 
 the twenty-five francs a month, but the poultry were installed 
 in the court at the back. For the first time in my life I had a 
 poultry -yard, and I experienced all the deliciously childish and 
 countrified sensations of ' fetching the eggs myself? 
 
 I responded to the graciousness of my new friends with stuffs, 
 Mussulman chaplets, tea, sugar, and perfumes. The letters of 
 introduction had instructed them concerning the object of my 
 visit, and having learned wisdom from my experience at Jenne, I 
 hastened to explain my purpose still further. They were assiduous 
 in their attentions, and constantly brought me new visitors, whose 
 acquaintance they thought might be useful to me. A charming 
 life now began for me in the house I had entered with so much 
 distrust. 
 
 In the penumbra of the little court, which was partly covered 
 
J 
 
 220 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 by a verandah, and still further defended by a large awning 
 against the ardour of the Saharian sun, I held meetings night 
 and morning. My visitors sat crouched upon their heels, while 
 
 MY COURTYARD AT TIMBUCTOO 
 
 I occupied the solitary chair, with a little table and some blank 
 paper before me. The picture recalled certain glimpses of the 
 Mosque .University of El Azhar at Cairo. It was a class, in fact, 
 with the proportions reversed, the professors being the many and 
 the pupil the one. The deliberate and picturesque phraseology 
 of the Oriental flowed on unceasingly, recitations being succeeded 
 by readings from the old chronicles of Timbuctoo. 
 
 There was nothing pedantic nor affected about our gatherings ; 
 each member related his memories at random, and passed from 
 subject to subject with every imaginable ease. Tea, coffee, 
 cigarettes, and kola nuts circulated at intervals. The neigh- 
 bours'* pigeons and ' my hens ' made an occasional irruption, but 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 with discretion. Chaffinches with red throats and tails, and the 
 lively little lizards who shared the apartments with me, joined 
 the party. They frolicked in our midst with the utmost effrontery. 
 The lizards ran about all over my guests, and the birds flew round 
 them, fluttering and singing incessantly. No one but myself 
 took any notice of them, however, so accustomed is Timbuctoo 
 to their numbers and caprices. 
 
 For several days I did not stir out of my house ; my life was 
 so full I had no leisure to do so. Yet so pleasantly active and 
 varied was it that I was content to remain in, and gradually, 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 without having set foot in the street, a new Timbuctoo was built 
 up before me. The wretched spectacle which had greeted me on 
 my arrival, and which I had believed ineffaceable, disappeared bit 
 by bit. A secret had clearly hovered over Timbuctoo the Mys- 
 terious. I had the eyes that saw ; and at last the image of the 
 great city, the wealthy Timbuctoo of the legends, was restored 
 to me. 
 
CHAPTER XI 
 
 TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 
 
 IN order to understand Jenne, we referred to the history of the 
 countries east of the Niger, and found there a vein of Egyptian 
 civilisation ; the origin of Timbuctoo, however, must be sought 
 in a different direction, for her past is connected with the Arabian 
 civilisation of northern Africa. 
 
 This same northern Africa was the world of the Berbers, and 
 included all those white people whom we have known under the 
 names of Touaregs in the Sahara, Kabyles in Algeria, Moors in 
 Morocco and Senegal, and Foulbes in their infiltrations into the 
 Sudan. Misled by their previous condition, we erroneously 
 believed them to have been nomads from all eternity ; but, like 
 the Jews, circumstances alone caused them to adopt a wandering 
 life, and in reality they represent the autochthonous populations 
 of Mediterranean Africa, of Morocco, Algeria, Tunis, and Tripoli. 
 Ibn Chaldoun, their great historian, observes : ' All northern 
 Africa, as far as the country of the blacks, has been inhabited by 
 Berber races since an epoch of which we know neither its anterior 
 events nor its commencement.' These races lived on the coasts 
 of Africa, and cultivated the beautiful valleys of Tell long before 
 the arrival of the Phoenician and Roman colonists. Carthage and 
 Rome set the Berbers in motion by crowding and pressing them 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 back into the interior, and they it was who transformed them 
 into a nomadic people. 
 
 Originally the Berbers of Morocco, that is to say the Moors, 
 
 MOORS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF TIMBUCTOO 
 
 were the last to suffer. The ancient colonisation, most intense 
 in Algeria and Tunis, was less direct in its effects on Morocco, 
 which was not entirely divested of its inhabitants by the arrival 
 of the colonists. Half its population, following the coasts of the 
 Atlantic, wandered towards the country of the blacks, while the 
 other half maintained themselves side by side with the new- 
 comers. This portion remained fairly stationary and compact 
 until the Arabian invasion. Moors and Arabs then combined 
 to conquer Spain, where for three centuries they enjoyed the 
 hospitality offered them by Europe. It is well known what 
 
TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 225 
 
 valuable services their polished manners and beautiful art, their 
 cultured literature and advanced industries, rendered to the cause 
 of Western renaissance. 
 
 What became of these brilliant people, we ask, when they 
 were driven out of Spain ? Returning to Morocco to find their 
 ancient patrimony in the hands of the Arabs, and being forced 
 to prolong their exodus into the south, they followed the Atlantic 
 
 MOORISH Wn.MKN 
 
 coasts and the negro countries and became nomads in their turn. 
 These Spanish Moors, wandering about the great lakes on the 
 left bank of the Niger in the neighbourhood of Oualata and 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 Timbuctoo, carried with them a name which leaves us in no doubt 
 as to their origin. They are called Andalusians to this day. 
 
 As we shall see later, these Moors, at the epoch of their 
 return, became one of the prime factors in Timbuctoo's great- 
 ness. The wonderful architects and the sumptuous possessors of 
 the palaces and mosques of Seville, Granada, and Cordova dwell 
 to-day in leathern tents, and the sands of the Sahara are their 
 only place of prayer. The vicissitudes of nomadic life have sadly 
 deteriorated them from the exalted civilisation to which they had 
 attained. Herds of goats and humped oxen, flocks of sheep, and 
 a few horses and books, form their sole wealth. The delicate 
 ornamentation of leather, their embroidered wallets, cushions, 
 and gun-cases, with some jewellery work, are all that recall the 
 characteristic manner of the art they introduced into Europe. 
 
 Let us now see what became of the Berbers of Algeria and 
 Tunis, countries in which the action of the Ancients was more 
 
 MOORISH ENCAMPMENT 
 
 brutal. A small number, thrown back beyond the Atlas Moun- 
 tains, found a land capable of maintaining them in the mountains 
 
TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 227 
 
 and valleys of Kabyle, and there they have remained, stationary 
 and impregnable, through all these centuries. 
 
 SCHOOL IN A MOORISH ENCAMPMENT 
 
 The greater part of them must have taken the roads of the 
 Sahara, at that time in the possession of the black races. Its 
 vast sands were more habitable and fertile then than they are 
 now, for it was the inexperience of these new-comers, their 
 excessive clearings, and the ravages of their herds, which diminished 
 the already parsimonious gifts of Nature to the desert. 
 
 This exile forced a new existence upon them which, little by 
 little, transformed the whole race ; the place, and everything they 
 found there, obliging them to adopt a special life, manners, and 
 even costume. We have called this portion of the Berber people 
 Touaregs, a name of Arabian origin, which they completely ignore, 
 only recognising the titles of Aoulemidens, Tenguaragifs, Tad- 
 damakets, Hoggars, Azers, and Airs, the patronymics of their 
 principal tribes. 
 
 The rearing of horses, oxen, and goats is their chief industry, 
 the milk and flesh of these animals furnishing, with the addition 
 of dates, their principal nourishment. Agriculture is scarcely 
 
228 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 possible under a sky from which the rain does not fall for six or 
 eight consecutive years. 
 
 Owing to their eyes not being accustomed to the terrible glare 
 of this desert, nor their lungs to its sand-storms, they adopted 
 a head-dress of two veils. One, the nicdb^ is rolled round the 
 temples, hanging down in front to protect their eyes ; the other, 
 the Utham, reaches from the nostrils to the edge of their clothing, 
 completely covering the lower part of the face. Hygiene was 
 obviously the only motive of this mysterious accoutrement, which 
 set the savants seeking all manner of far-fetched origins with 
 which to endow these Touaregs. This is proved not only by 
 their own statements, but also by the sobriquet ' mouths for 
 flies, 1 which they give to all who do not wear this costume. The 
 veils are never removed, even at meal-times, and the garb has 
 
 mm' W 
 1 
 
 ^ ' ' ; 
 
 MOORISH FLOCKS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF TIMBUCTOO 
 
 become so much a part of them that ' any one being deprived 
 of it is unrecognisable to his friends and relatives. If one of 
 their number is killed in battle and divested of his veil, no one 
 can identify him until it has been restored to its place. ' And 
 
TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 229 
 
 this in spite of the fact that the bridge of the nose and the eyes 
 alone are visible. 
 
 The scarcity of water and their speedy exhaustion of the scanty 
 pasturage of the desert kept them perpetually on the march. 
 With this constant movement any aggregation of their life was 
 impossible ; every 
 social and political 
 organisation disap- 
 peared, and they 
 gradually lost all 
 notion of law and 
 authority. Like 
 the Jews, and all 
 people thrown out 
 of their natural 
 paths, their souls 
 and brains became 
 steeped in vice, and 
 it was not long 
 before they had 
 become the mere 
 prey of their in- 
 stincts. Their 
 nomadic life soon 
 reduced them to the level of vagabonds, thieves, and brigands, 
 and the only law they recognised was the right of the strongest. 
 
 Theft was their natural industry a branch of education, in fact 
 and they augmented the meagreness of their herds by extorting 
 ransoms from some of their neighbours and completely despoiling 
 others. Travellers and merchants were their principal victims, but 
 when these failed they robbed and killed each other ; for, so far 
 
 TOUAREG WITH ' NICAB ' AND ' LITHAM ' 
 
TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 231 
 
 from their tribes being united, they were divided by the most 
 bitter and persistent hatreds. 
 
 They adopted a vague form of Islamism which they reduced to 
 a belief in talismans. Since no morality, Mohammedan or other- 
 wise, found foothold among them, they soon became characterised 
 by the worst vices, only retaining the one quality of physical 
 endurance. Thieves and murderers when in sufficient numbers, 
 they are the most obsequious of beggars when convinced of their 
 weakness, and are, in either case, absolutely faithless. A Sudanese 
 proverb says, ' The word of a Touareg, like water fallen on the sand, 
 is never to be found again/ They have nobles, serfs, and slaves 
 among them, but nobility none ; if you wish to find any quality 
 other than vanity and pride, you must look for it among their 
 negro slaves. Neither age nor womanhood inspires them with 
 either pity or respect. Bloodthirsty and cruel as they are, they 
 do not even possess that unlimited courage which forms the 
 redeeming characteristic of the condottieri. Their valour is dis- 
 played at night during the sleep of their victims or adversaries. 
 Ruse is their principal weapon, even though they never show them- 
 selves without a spear in their hand, a sword at their side, and a 
 poignard attached to the left arm. The Sudanese have bestowed 
 upon them three epithets which epitomise their psychology : 
 ' Thieves, Hyenas, and the Abandoned of God." 
 
 Yet it is to these people, who have become the most useless 
 and nefarious on the face of the earth, that Timbuctoo owes its 
 origin. 
 
 Towards the fifth century of the Hegira (1100 of our era) a 
 Touareg tribe, the Maksara, 1 established its herds between the 
 
 1 The Markassighi of today, settled to the east of Timbuctoo, and forming part of 
 the Tenguaragif family. 
 
232 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 town of Arawan in the Sahara and the little village of Amtagh, 1 
 situated on the banks of the Niger. 
 
 During the summer and dry season they pastured their flocks 
 on the shores of the river, returning to the desert for the winter 
 floods. In one of their many wanderings they noticed an oasis in 
 the midst of the sands, formed by an overflow of the Niger. It 
 was a narrow depression, having somewhat the appearance of a 
 river, and must have been fairly deep, since the hippopotamus 
 found his way there, and was a place in which the Touaregs could 
 always be sure of finding some vegetation, as well as abundant and 
 excellent water. 
 
 The situation was an admirable one for man and beast, 
 and, with the palm-trees which reared their elegant forms there, 
 did not lack a certain charm of aspect. They established a 
 fixed camp on this spot in order to prevent its occupation by 
 others during their absence. They cut down bushes of thorny 
 mimosa from the neighbouring thickets, and formed, according 
 to their custom, a same, or enclosure, to keep out the wild 
 animals of the desert lions, panthers, and hyaenas. Straw huts 
 were built behind this shelter, in which the Touaregs placed 
 their provisions and other cumbersome properties. They left 
 some Bailas, or slaves, there, who kept guard under the super- 
 intendence of an old woman called ' Tomboutou ' (The mother 
 with the large navel). 
 
 The sobriquet became popular in the country, and contributed 
 
 to the speedy renown of the advantages of their encampment.

 \ 'Travellers paused there," says the Tank e Sudan. 'The popu- 
 lations increased by the power and will of God, and the people

 began to build themselves fixed dwellings. Caravans coming from

 / 
 Mali kingdom delayed at the camp to renew their stores. A 
 
 market was soon formed ; a high enclosure of matting was sub- 
 stituted for the barrier of dead thorns, and it became a meeting- 
 lace for people travelling by canoe or cam el/ 
 
 The place did not deserve the name of town, however, until 
 the merchants of Jenne (which had been a city for some three 
 hundred years) settled there. The tradition which I have just 
 mentioned concerning the origin of the town was confirmed in 
 Timbuctoo. ' The Touaregs are the fathers of the town, 1 my 
 friends told me. ' When thou wert little, what didst thou call her 
 who nourished thee at her breast ? Thou calledst her mother, 
 didst thou not ? Well, Jenne is the mother of Timbuctoo, for 
 it was she who made it live and grow ; and it was she who, by 
 bringing hither her merchandise, caused it to become a great 
 place of commerce/ 
 
 The merchants of Jenne taught Timbuctoo to build houses 
 of baked brick, and to replace the same of mats by a low earthen 
 wall. They also built a mosque, afterwards the Cathedral Mosque 
 of Ghingaraber; and a wealthy woman, a native of Sokolo, 
 erected a second temple, which became later the University 
 Mosque of Sankore. Thus enlarged, Timbuctoo entered into 
 competition with Oualata. 1 The latter town was the great 
 cosmopolitan market of western Africa in the twelfth century. 
 4 It was with Oualata that the caravans traded, and it was there 
 the most pious, learned, and wealthy men lived. They went 
 thither from all countries and all tribes, from Egypt, Fezzara, 
 Soussa, Tuat, Tafilalet, Ghadames, Ouargla, and Fez. 1 This 
 active and intelligent population, which was strongly imbued 
 with the Arabian civilisation, could not fail to make acquaint- 
 
 1 Called Ganata and Gana by the Arabs in the ancient texts, and Birou by the 
 Songhois. 
 
TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 235 
 
 ance with Timbuctoo and the many advantages of its position. 
 The numerous conquests of the Mali kings, however, which dis- 
 turbed western Africa in the thirteenth century, diverted the 
 caravans little by little from Oualata. Its merchants and scholars 
 emigrated to the new city, and were supplemented there by a 
 fraction of the great Moorish tribe of Senhadia. By the four- 
 teenth century Oualata had become entirely eclipsed, and the 
 splendours of Timbuctoo had grown from her ruins. 
 
 The Touaregs, who still pursued the wandering life of the 
 desert, contented themselves with nominating a governor of the 
 town who levied taxes in their name. They augmented their 
 demand in proportion to the increasing prosperity of the town, 
 until inhabitants and caravans alike were forced to pay veritable 
 ransoms. Becoming, not unnaturally, weary of this, the people 
 invited Koukour Moussa, whose kingdom of Mali was then at its 
 height, to take possession of the town. He, being just returned 
 from the conquest of the Songhois and a pilgrimage to Mecca, 
 entered Timbuctoo in 1330. He presented the Cathedral Mosque 
 with a minaret of pyramidal form, built himself a palace, and 
 installed a governor there upon his departure. The dominion of 
 the Malinkas did not open very happily, however. The cupidity 
 of the people of Mossi had already been excited by the renown of 
 Timbuctoo, and their sultan now appeared before its gates at the 
 head of a large army. The new masters of the town took flight, 
 while the enemy pillaged and burned. When the Sultan of Mossi 
 and his army withdrew, laden with spoils, the people of Mali 
 repossessed themselves of Timbuctoo, and remained its masters for 
 a hundred years (1337-1434). 
 
 The young city arose once more from its ruins, and Timbuctoo 
 expanded as the kingdom of Mali declined. 4 The original masters 
 of the town did not fail to take advantage of the deterioration of 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 their rivals. The Maksara Touaregs pillaged the outskirts of the 
 town, and the Malinkas were afraid to offer any resistance. Akil, 
 the chief of the Touaregs, sent a message to them at last, saying, 
 ' If you cannot defend Timbuctoo, cease to occupy it." 1 Whereupon 
 the people of Mali retired. 
 
 The nomads now reigned for forty years, committing the 
 grossest excesses. They proved themselves tyrants and oppressors, 
 accumulating exactions, hunting people from their dwellings, and 
 violating the women ; and for the second time the town was 
 forced to seek a new master. 
 
 Oumar, its governor, having been wronged by his own people 
 (the Touaregs), secretly resolved upon revenge. With this 
 intention he sent a messenger to Sunni Ali, giving information 
 concerning Akil and the Touaregs, exposing their weakness, and 
 promising to deliver up the town. The messenger took Oumar's 
 sandals with him as a guarantee of good faith. Sunni Ali, who 
 was at that time (middle of the fifteenth century) laying the 
 foundations of the Songhoi empire, accepted the invitation. At 
 the appearance of his cavalry on the river-bank opposite the dune 
 of Amtagh, Akil resolved on flight. He departed, followed by 
 his people and a great number of the learned men of Sankore, to 
 seek refuge in Oualata. Sunni Ali was furious at the exodus of 
 marabuts, and suspecting the remainder of being the friends and 
 accomplices of the Touaregs, he heaped every imaginable ill- 
 treatment upon them. Did he show himself equally cruel towards 
 the remainder of the inhabitants ? In spite of the old chronicles, 
 I do not believe he did, for the reasons I have given in the history 
 of the Songhois. 
 
 The year 1496, the year of the capture of Timbuctoo by Sunni 
 Ali, is an important one in the history of that city. For the 
 
TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 237 
 
 future she forms part of the Songhoi empire, steadily keeping pace 
 with the progress of the latter, until she becomes Timbuctoo the 
 Great, the city of universal renown, the fabled Queen of the 
 Sudan. 
 
 More than a century of tranquillity now lies before her, the 
 century of Askia the Great. Owing to his wise creation of a 
 standing army, his great era of war had no disturbing influence 
 upon the Sudan. The well-regulated and powerful organisation 
 which, with their viceroys and governors, he bestowed upon the 
 conquered territories, soon brought them under control. 
 
 The immense kingdom of the Songhois now extended over the 
 desert from Thegazza to Agades, and the conquered Touaregs 
 renounced their brigandage to become docile auxiliaries in the 
 hands of Askia. The routes of the desert were perfectly secure, 
 and the caravans came and went with an activity hitherto 
 unknown. 
 
 This security, spreading north and south of Timbuctoo, was 
 not the only element of her prosperity, but was seconded 
 by the organisation and inspection of her markets, the unifica- 
 tion of weights and measures, and the stern suppression of all 
 falsifications. Timbuctoo, more than any other town in the 
 Sudan, profited by the measures and victories of Askia the 
 Great. 
 
 The city had now doubled its extent. Its houses were well 
 built, and arranged in orderly streets. The ancient mosques had 
 been restored and new ones built. A great emigration of 
 Songhois reinforced the Jennereans, counterbalancing the Arabian 
 and Berber elements, which had hitherto predominated. The 
 dialects of Jenne and Gao became its current speech, Arabic 
 remaining the medium of communication with strangers and the 
 language of science. The university of Sankore was at the height 
 
238 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 of its prosperity, the fame of its professors being known not only 
 in the black countries but throughout Arabian Africa itself. 
 Learned strangers Hocked hither from Morocco, Tunis, and Egypt. 
 The civilisation of Arabia clasped hands with the civilisation of 
 Egypt, and from their union resulted the apogee of Timbuctoo 
 (1494-1591). 
 
 Such was her splendour that our imaginations are still dazzled 
 by its reflections, three centuries after the setting of her star. So 
 great was her glory that, in spite of all the vicissitudes she has 
 suffered, her vitality is not yet extinguished. 
 
 The decadence of Timbuctoo began with the Moorish conquest 
 in 1591. The powerful links forged by Askia the Great being 
 once snapped, the whole of western Africa was shaken. While 
 the last of the Askias was fighting for national independence on 
 the eastern shores of the Niger, Jenne revolted in the west, her 
 example being followed by the Touaregs, Foulbes, and Malinkase. 
 The north and south were thrown into confusion, and Timbuctoo, 
 their intermediary, seeing her commerce mutilated, rebelled in her 
 turn. She was brutally repressed by the conquerors, and the 
 flower of her scholars exiled to Morocco (1594). A terrible 
 dearth, provoked by the lack of rain, visited the town, and her 
 inhabitants were reduced to 'eating the corpses of animals, 
 and even of men/ This was followed by the pestilence in 
 1618. 
 
 When the Sudan had once more regained tranquillity, 
 Timbuctoo, by reason of her proximity to the Moorish frontier, 
 had become the capital of her conquerors. The rivalries of the 
 Roumas reigned within her walls, their pashas disputing the 
 supreme power, and their troops settling their differences in the 
 streets. The town was the constant scene of some panic, and 
 
TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 239 
 
 from the moment the disorganisation of the Moorish colony 
 became evident, her decline was rapid. 
 
 Without, the Touaregs and other nomadic tribes rose again in 
 revolt. The Roumas were still strong enough to repress them, 
 but one can imagine the disastrous effect these riots had upon the 
 trade of the town. Within, the rivalries of the Moorish chiefs 
 grew more and more bitter. The competitors for the title of 
 Pasha pillaged and otherwise ill-treated the inhabitants of the 
 town. The population divided, and took sides with this, that, or 
 the other aspirant. Barricades were raised, fighting went on in 
 the streets, and the poor pillaged the wealthy. In 1716 one of 
 these revolutions lasted four months. No one went to market 
 during all that time, ' and the grass began to grow there. 1 At 
 another time (1735) one of the rivals seized Kabara, and pre- 
 vented the vessels unloading their merchandise and despatching it 
 to Timbuctoo. 
 
 It is not surprising, therefore, that the town was depopulated, 
 and that the caravans grew fewer and further between. Touaregs, 
 Berbers, and Foulbes added to the general confusion. They began 
 by disturbing the outskirts of the town, and it became necessary to 
 place patrols on the road to Kabara in order to protect the 
 merchants trading with Timbuctoo. The resistance of the 
 Roumas grew slowly weaker, and in 1770 the veiled men had 
 become strong enough to invest the town for three months. The 
 Roumas, incapable of enforcing peace, bought it. ' They paid the 
 Touaregs a tribute of eighteen of the best horses of the town, 
 twelve hundred garments, and seven thousand mitkals of 
 
 gold: 
 
 The nomads spread freely over the banks and valley of the 
 Niger, pillaging the vessels making for Kabara, and thus injuring, 
 even at a distance, the trade of Timbuctoo.

 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 PANORAMA OF 
 
 Iii the beginning of the nineteenth century the city had 
 relapsed into the same state as that preceding its conquest by 
 Sunni Ali. The Roumas had become the mere representatives of 
 the Touaregs, governing and imposing taxes in their name. Straw 
 huts increased in numbers, and the new quarters at the north of 
 the city, which had been built in the time of Askia, were com- 
 pletely deserted, the houses falling into ruins. As its decline 
 became more accentuated the town diminished in extent until it 
 had shrunk to its dimensions of the sixteenth century. 
 
 Timbuctoo was re-delivered from the hands of the Touaregs in 
 1827. Cheikou Ahmadou, the Foulbean leader, made successful 
 war against the nomads, and took possession of the town. But the 
 Touaregs, grown aggressive, wearied out his successor, who agreed, 
 for the sake of peace, to pay them a third of the taxes levied upon 
 the city. This understanding lasted until El Hadj Omar destroyed 
 the power of the Foulbes in 1861. 
 
TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 241 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 The most critical period of her history now opened for 
 Timbuctoo. The roads of the Sudan and desert alike had never 
 been less safe, nor had her commerce ever encountered such 
 difficulties, all security having disappeared in the town itself. 
 
 If Timbuctoo was now without a master, she was in the pos- 
 session of a thousand tyrants. Touaregs, Tenguaragifs and Irre- 
 genaten divided her among themselves and adorned her with the 
 tragic and sordid attire which now clothes the Queen of the 
 Sudan. 
 
 That time has been described to me in the following words : 
 ' Thou hast seen those veiled men in sombre garments, with chest 
 and back covered with red and yellow talismans as though by 
 cuirasses. When they come to us now they are modest, but before 
 the French arrived they walked insolently through the streets, 
 carrying iron spears. Every year we paid them tribute in gold or 
 kind, corn, salt, garments," and turbans, etc. Their chiefs with 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 their retinues were well lodged when they came here. The cara- 
 vans bound for this town paid them toll in the desert, and they 
 exacted toll upon the river also, from the fleets going to Kabara. 
 
 This did not suffice 
 them ; these were 
 the least of our 
 evils. From one 
 end of the year 
 to the other they 
 treated us as cap- 
 tives of war, as 
 slaves. They were 
 constantly arriv- 
 ing in groups and 
 dispersing through 
 the town. All 
 doors were closed 
 as soon as they 
 appeared, but they 
 beat upon the 
 doors, and thou 
 canst see the 
 traces of the heavy 
 blows from their 
 a lances everywhere. 
 We were forced 
 to open to them, 
 
 and without paying the least attention to the master of the 
 house or his family, they would install themselves in the best 
 rooms, taking all the cushions and couches, insolently demanding 
 food and drink, and insisting upon having sugar, honey, and meat. 
 
 
TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 243 
 
 On departing to rejoin their camp the only acknowledgment they 
 made was to steal something from the house and spit upon their 
 host. 
 
 'If they alighted upon some man too poor to satisfy their 
 exactions, they vented their ill-humour by destroying his belong- 
 ings, and any attempt at resistance was met by their raised spear. 
 If they arrived at midnight, accommodation must be found and a 
 repast prepared for them. 
 
 6 They took possession of anything that pleased them in the 
 markets. All the shops and sellers of stuffs and garments had 
 people posted about the town to give notice of their appearance, 
 and every one barricaded their doors. They robbed the passers- 
 by in the streets. If they met a man wearing a beautifully 
 embroidered robe or a new garment, or even only a clean one, 
 they instantly despoiled him of it. They snatched the golden 
 ornaments, coral necklaces, and adornments of glass beads from 
 the women, and plundered children and slaves in the same 
 manner. 
 
 ' The schools were formerly held in front of the houses of the 
 masters, and our children played in the streets as in other parts of 
 the Sudan. But the Touaregs used to seize them and carry them 
 off, and only restored them to us upon the payment of heavy 
 ransoms. If a man whom they suspected of being rich had hidden 
 all his valuables, they would leave some small thing behind on 
 quitting his house, and then would return in numbers, crying out 
 that they had been robbed, and the man would be forced to pay 
 an indemnity.' 1 
 
 These narratives would be interrupted by sundry resigned 
 ' Irtish Allah!'' (May God's will be done). 'But why did you not 
 unite against your enemies?' I asked them. 'Oh, if we resisted 
 them it was still worse. One day some Touaregs met a young 
 
244 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 man returning from the market with some meat he had bought. 
 They took his purchase from him, and when the young man re- 
 sisted, the Abandoned of God killed him with their spears. All 
 for a piece of meat ! At another time a woman who was alone in 
 a house was ill-treated by one of them. Her cries attracted her 
 brother, who mortally wounded the Touareg in his wrath. The 
 avenger immediately fled and sought refuge in Sarafara, but he 
 was forced to return, and the veiled men cut his throat as they 
 would a sheep's. 
 
 4 We could not prevail against them, because we are merchants 
 and not fighters. And if we had subdued them in the town they 
 would still have remained our masters, because they controlled the 
 routes of the caravans and the road to Kabara. They could have 
 ruined us and left us to die of hunger whenever they liked. 
 
 4 Strangers sometimes gave these hyaenas a lesson. Four or five 
 years ago a caravan from the south, composed of three hundred of 
 the men of Mossi, was staying in the town. One of them, wear- 
 ing a beautiful new turban, encountered a Touareg, who snatched 
 it from his head and ran away. But the people of Mossi are 
 active and brave, and this man gave chase to the thief and over- 
 powered him. Other Touaregs, however, came up and rescued 
 their companion. 
 
 ' The man of Mossi ran to the chief of the caravan, who said, 
 "Beat the alarum of the people of Mossi upon the tom-toms." 
 His people, armed with spears and bows and arrows, came running 
 to answer the summons. Their chief distributed honey-dolo, and 
 they set out to find the Touaregs. The principal personages of 
 Timbuctoo sought to prevent the conflict. " No ! " replied the 
 chief, " we are strangers here and your sacred guests. We have 
 been injured, and we will avenge ourselves or die." The kaid of 
 the town offered to give them a similar turban. " No," said the 
 
TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 245 
 
 chief of the Mossi, "it is the Touaregs who have stolen it, 
 and it is they who must make amends." They were only to be 
 appeased on hearing that the Touaregs had prudently quitted the 
 town/ 
 
 Such was the existence of Timbuctoo during the last thirty- 
 five years. One can imagine the disastrous results such a state of 
 
 A THOROUGHFARE IN TIMBUCTOO 
 
 affairs was bound to produce in the long-run. Finding themselves 
 thus molested, the strangers who ventured there gradually lessened 
 in numbers. Weary of living in a constant state of alarm, and of 
 submitting to exactions to which they saw no end, the people 
 began to emigrate. The strangers who had settled in the city 
 returned to their native country. Natives who had relations in 
 the neighbouring countries joined them there. The deserted 
 houses cracked, their walls crumbled and fell to pieces, forming 
 
246 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 the unexpected and inexplicable heaps of ruins which greeted 
 me on my arrival. 
 
 The poorest and wealthiest alone remained faithful to the city. 
 The first, living in straw huts, possessed nothing, and consequently 
 had nothing to lose. The second, the opulent merchants, could, 
 owing to their great fortunes, manage to endure these annoyances, 
 and the emigration of the smaller traders, moreover, permitted 
 them to augment their business, and therefore their profits. 
 
 No one ever gets accustomed to pillage and ill-treatment how- 
 ever, whatever the compensations may be ; and to avoid being 
 robbed in the open street, and seeing their houses turned upside 
 down, the inhabitants adopted a new manner of living. They 
 transformed their garments and dwellings, and ceasing to be 
 Timbuctoo the Great, they became Timbuctoo the Mysterious. 
 
 Instead of the imposing white turbans of the natives and the 
 beautiful dark ones (made of shining tissues) of the Moors, the 
 people cover their heads with unappetising rags, or cheap caps. 
 Shabby old shoes are substituted for the yellow Turkish slippers 
 of the women and the silk embroidered, soft, red leather boots of 
 the men. The caftans and the ample garments of dazzling white- 
 ness, the beautifully embroidered vestments, the fringed and 
 ornamented Dissas (thrown over the shoulder as the toreador wears 
 his cloak), have all disappeared. They wear instead old scanty 
 clothes, whose dirtiness, being their sole adornment, offers no 
 temptation to the Touaregs. In place of the long cane, orna- 
 mented with leather or chased iron, on which the Sudanese loves 
 to support his fine form, they use a plain stick of a cheap white 
 wood. Their one idea being to avoid any sign of affluence which 
 might attract the attention of their oppressors. 
 
 On the few occasions of their going out, the women attire 
 themselves in the coarsest stuffs, and take off all their gold and 
 
TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 247 
 
 amber ornaments, and the slaves, before going to fetch water at 
 the town gates, hide their modest jewellery. The children are 
 kept inside the courts, and the schoolmaster holds his classes with- 
 in his house. 
 
 The houses are disguised like their owners, and, to escape the 
 visits of the veiled men, all appearance of wealth and prosperity is 
 avoided. I will not assert that they are voluntarily defaced, but 
 time and weather are allowed to work their will upon them 
 unhindered. The tornadoes of winter have been permitted to 
 wash away the rough-casting and expose the baked bricks of the 
 facades ; the walls of their terraces have crumbled, and the little 
 
 SUDANESE WEARING THE ' DISSA ' 
 
 Moorish windows fallen away. In front of the houses, the banks 
 of earth (tim-tims) on which the well-to-do were wont to pass 
 their hours of leisure have entirely disappeared. 
 
 By these means the town very soon acquired a tumble-down 
 
248 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 and battered appearance. Everything seems to be falling into the 
 streets, except the doors those obstinately closed doors that had 
 so astonished me on my arrival. They are the objects of the most 
 
 
 TIMBUCTOO: A CORNER OF THE TOWN 
 
 studied care, and are set up regardless of cost. Heavy planks of a 
 very hard wood are brought from a distance for this purpose, and 
 are adorned with armour like any gentleman of Agincourt. Thus 
 barricaded, the inhabitants, under cover of a simulated misery, 
 live the silent life of the cloisters. They have given up grinding 
 their kuss-kuss in the great wooden mortars common to the 
 Sudan, and now crush the grain between two stones and pound 
 
TIMBUCTOO ACROSS THE CENTURIES 249 
 
 it without noise, for the sound of the heavy pestle would inevit- 
 ably attract some marauding Touareg in search of a meal. 
 If a knocking on the door is heard, the whole household, hastily 
 concealing its valuables, assumes the silence of death. The 
 unfamiliar visitor has to loudly recite his names, his recommenda- 
 tions, and the purpose of his visit. If his discourse is judged satis- 
 factory, and it is decided to show some sign of life, there are still 
 questions to be asked and answered before the door is finally 
 opened. 
 
 The same mystery naturally attends all business transactions ; 
 a moment must be snatched when all Touaregs are known to be at 
 some distance, otherwise it is necessary to wait until nightfall. 
 
 I was initiated into the secret of Timbuctoo, and her disastrous 
 appearance was explained to me. With my narrators for guides I 
 explored the same streets and houses that I had seen on my 
 arrival. The armoured doors were opened for me, and there lay 
 revealed all that these tumble-down old places concealed. I was 
 seized with admiration both for the splendour of Timbuctoo's past 
 and her ingenuity and tenacity of to-day. 
 
CHAPTER XII 
 
 THE COMMERCE AND LIFE OF TIMBUCTOO 
 
 TIMBUCTOO is the meeting-place of all who travel by camel or 
 canoe. 1 
 
 This simple dictum of an old Sudanese chronicle excellently 
 expresses the commercial greatness of the city ; the ' canoe ' 
 represent- 
 ing the 
 south of 
 Timb uc- 
 t o o (the 
 Sudan) 
 and the 
 'camel' in- 
 dicating 
 the Sahara 
 and the 
 whole of 
 northern 
 
 Africa, Morocco, Algeria, Tuat, Tunis, Tripoli, and, finally, 
 Europe. 
 
 An intermediary of exchange between north and south having 
 become essential, Timbuctoo supplies the part, and serves to unite 
 
 250 
 
COMMERCE AND LIFE OF TIMBUCTOO 251 
 
 the Berber and Arab with the Negraic world. This task is 
 marvellously facilitated by her unique situation. Placed as she 
 is at the outlet of a labyrinth of tributaries, creeks, and channels, 
 at the point where the Niger bends abruptly from the western to 
 its eastern course, she offers an easy point of concentration to 
 north and south. Here the Sudan can assemble her many 
 different products, and satisfy all her clients of the north at 
 the same time. Timbuctoo is like a port with bonded docks 
 situated on the coast of an opulent continent, with a sea of 
 sand stretching before her upon which the fleets of the desert 
 come and go. 
 
 The commerce of the desert and the organisation of its 
 caravans were established by the Moorish and Arabian tribes 
 
 who dwelt on the 
 confines of the de- 
 sert. The country 
 fjjP in which they 
 
 pitched their tents 
 permits of no cul- 
 tivation, but fav- 
 ours the rearing 
 of innumerable 
 camels, and the 
 nomads offer the 
 native merchants 
 ACARAVAN the hire of these 
 
 useful animals 1 in exchange for cereals and clothing. 
 
 1 The hire of a camel plying between Morocco and Timbuctoo costs from 
 forty to fifty francs, and merchants usually employ from thirty to forty of these 
 animals. 
 
252 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 On account of its proximity and its former conquest of the 
 city, Morocco has become the principal client of Timbuctoo, 
 Tendouf, Souara, Marrakesh, Fez, and Tafilalet being the points 
 of departure of its caravans. Algeria is only of secondary import- 
 ance, as its relations with the city are indirect, being established 
 by means of Tuat ; in the same manner Tunis and Tripoli trade 
 through Ghadames. The caravans from the coast are chiefly 
 laden with European stuffs, the principal fabric being the indigo 
 blue cotton called Guinea, which is imported all over Africa. 
 It is worth from fourteen to twenty-five francs the length in 
 Timbuctoo, and only seven in Senegal. White calico is also in 
 great request, and a few silks are numbered among the more 
 luxurious textiles. In a general way the odd medley of patterns 
 and colours which are in such demand upon the coast are despised 
 in Nigerian Africa, their place being taken by more sober designs 
 of Arabian character. 
 
 Other articles of commerce are firearms, gunpowder, cutlery, 
 paper (sold on the Niger at twenty-five or thirty centimes 
 a sheet), scissors, needles, mirrors, silk, and seed pearls (for 
 embroidery), amber, coral, large pearls for necklaces, spices 
 (principally cloves), sugar, tea, coffee, perfumes, tobacco from 
 Tuat, teapots, cups, snuff-boxes, dates, carpets, fez, burnouses, 
 caftans, etc. 
 
 The camels are only partly loaded on starting, for half-way the 
 caravans complete their freights with that unique article, salt. I 
 have laid stress upon the primary importance of this product in 
 former chapters, and it only remains for me to show how it is 
 procured. 
 
 The long depression in the western Sahara bearing the name 
 of El Djouf is a vast mine of rock salt. We have seen that the 
 supply first came out of Thegazza, and that these mines were 
 
COMMERCE AND LIFE OF TIMBUCTOO 253 
 
 abandoned in the sixteenth century for those of Taoudenni, 
 situated nearer Timbuctoo. 
 
 Little accustomed as they are to smiling pastures, Taoudenni, 
 according to the people of the desert, is one of the dreariest spots 
 on the face of the earth, possessing neither trees nor vegeta- 
 tion, while the little 
 water that is to be 
 found there is salt. 
 Shade, and water fit 
 to drink, must be 
 sought at the wells of 
 Oued Teli, distant a 
 day's journey. Not 
 even earth for the con- 
 struction of dwellings 
 is to be found, houses 
 and mosques being 
 built of rock salt and 
 roofed with camel 
 skins. The inhabi- 
 tants of the town 
 subsist upon the dates 
 the caravans bring on 
 
 their way to Timbuctoo, and the cereals and other provisions they 
 leave behind on their return. 
 
 Under a thin covering of sand the mineral is found in clearly 
 marked layers. It is dug out in large lumps by slaves, and 
 trimmed down to blocks (about. 3 ft. 7 in. by 1 ft. 3 in.), looking 
 like bars of red or grey-veined marble, and which, as they come 
 out of the mine, are stamped with the trade-marks of the 
 different contractors. They are worth from two to six francs, 
 
 A BLOCK OF SALT 
 
254 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 according to their quality, and a camel can carry four or five at 
 a time. 
 
 Before entering the Negraic countries they undergo a regular 
 toilet at Timbuctoo, where they are embellished with geometrical 
 
 designs in black paint, and the name of some venerated chief 
 is written on them in Arabic characters. Sidi Yaia, the patron 
 of Timbuctoo, Abd 1 el Kader, the great Algerian chief, Cheikou 
 Ahmadou, El Hadj Omar, etc., are honoured in this fashion. 
 Thus ornamented, they are bound round with thongs of raw 
 leather, which are arranged to hold the fragments together in 
 .cases of fracture. The fact that the manufacture of these 
 thongs occupies an entire branch of business from one end of 
 
COMMERCE AND LIFE OF TIMBUCTOO 255 
 
 the year to another will give some idea of the importance of 
 her salt trade to Timbuctoo. 
 
 The densest and whitest blocks are the most in demand, 
 those veined with red being of an inferior quality. Their price 
 in Timbuctoo varies according to the greater or less security 
 of the Sudanese routes. 'There was a time, 1 said the old men, 
 ' when these blocks cost only from five to ten francs ' ; but during 
 my sojourn there thirty or forty francs more nearly represented 
 the price paid for them. An exporter from Jenne and San- 
 sanding will purchase five hundred blocks at a time. Bought at 
 thirty francs, for example, and worth forty-five at Sarafara and 
 double at Jenne, they represent about seventy or eighty francs 
 
 RETAILING SALT 
 
 apiece at San or Sansanding, increasing in value at the same 
 rate until they reach Mossi and the regions of Lake Chad. 
 With such voyages in prospect the advantage these bars of 
 
256 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 salt possess over our powdered substance is sufficiently obvious. 
 Hard as stone, and proof against injury from moisture, they do 
 not suffer from the loss and theft to which our sacks of salt are 
 peculiarly liable. The seller retails them in small pieces propor- 
 tioned to the demand. They often serve the traveller as a 
 means of barter, for the Sudanese who declines to sell his 
 provisions for cowries, silver, or even gold, will never refuse 
 a small lump of salt. 
 
 Having completed its freight at Taoudenni, and paid one 
 or several tolls to the Touaregs, the caravan reaches Timbuctoo, 
 if it has not been entirely pillaged by the way. It does not 
 enter the town, which would be seriously encumbered by its 
 multitude of camels, but encamps before the northern walls 
 in the Abaradiou, or caravan suburb. This quarter consists of 
 groups of straw cabins surrounded by thorny fences, which 
 recall the early settlement of Touaregs that gave birth to the 
 city of Timbuctoo. 
 
 The merchants accompanying the caravans lodge in the 
 town, but the camel-drivers find shelter in the Abaradiou. The 
 camels are watered at large pools lying near, and are pastured 
 on the neighbouring dunes, where the sober-minded animals 
 
COMMERCE AND LIFE OF TIMBUCTOO 257 
 
 find the camel-grass and other miserable and thorny vegeta- 
 tion which form their chief delicacies. 
 
 As one would suppose, the number and importance of the 
 caravans vary in direct relation with the security of the Sahara 
 on the one side and the prosperity of the Sudan on the 
 other. The large caravans include from six hundred to a 
 thousand camels and from three to five hundred men, their 
 freight representing from six hundred thousand to a million 
 francs'-worth of goods. They generally arrive from December 
 to January and from July to August. Smaller caravans of 
 sixty or a hundred camels are arriving all the year round, the 
 town annually receiving about fifty or sixty thousand camels. 
 In the year following our occupation (evidently an abnormal 
 one) the official returns only stated fourteen thousand camels. 
 
 Like the burdens of the camels, the cargoes of the fleets 
 comprise two distinct parts. One portion, destined for Tim- 
 buctoo and the towns and nomadic tribes of the Sahara, consists 
 principally of matters of alimentation, such as millet, rice, 
 karita, manioc, arachides, honey, kola nuts, neta and baobab 
 flour, monkey-bread, tamarinds, onions and tobacco (cheaper and 
 inferior to that of Tuat), dried fish, and in addition, soap, iron, 
 antimony, cotton, straw hats, potteries, and calabashes. The 
 other is specially allotted to Morocco, Tuat, and Ghadames, 
 and comprises gold, ivory, ostrich plumes, raw leather, wax, 
 incense, civet musk, indigo, gum, etc., and includes a few 
 slaves. 
 
 The different methods of northern and southern transport being 
 now explained, the commerce of Timbuctoo appears in all its 
 simplicity. The camels transfer their burdens to the canoes, and 
 the vessels confide their cargoes to the camels, Timbuctoo being 
 

COMMERCE AND LIFE OF TIMBUCTOO 259 
 
 the place of trans-shipment. The city is merely a temporary 
 depot, situated between the borders of the desert and the 
 copiously watered valleys of the south, and is so completely a 
 town of warehouses and docks that none of its merchants 
 possesses either camel or boat. What part, then, do its people 
 play if they are neither exporters nor importers? They are 
 brokers, contractors, and landlords. 'The guest is a present from 
 God, 1 says an Arabian maxim much in vogue in Timbuctoo, where 
 there are no caravansaries. The inhabitant offers gratuitous 
 board and lodging to the stranger merchant for the first three 
 
260 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 days, and interprets the noble precept in a disinterested and 
 elevated manner. There is a perfectly straightforward under- 
 standing that at parting on the fourth day the guest shall hire 
 one of his host's houses (some own as many as ten or fifteen) for 
 the remainder of his stay. These dwellings are similar to the one 
 I occupied, and are large enough to serve as warehouse as well as 
 habitation. Moreover, the part of diatigui or landlord does not 
 
 end there; he is expected 
 to instruct the stranger on 
 the current prices, the 
 
 UNLOADING CAMELS 
 
 abundance or scarcity of the product he has come to buy or 
 sell, the standing of any client who may offer himself, and 
 also to assist his guest in making his purchases, the price of 
 lodging thus including the benefits of brokerage. 
 
 I too made use of my landlord according to custom, asking 
 him to advise me in the choice of tradespeople, and appealing 
 to him in all my business transactions. I requested him to con- 
 duct me about the town as though I were some merchant of 
 Mossi or Tafilalet, and he led me through the markets and 
 
COMMERCE AND LIFE OF TIMBUCTOO 261 
 
 showed me the interior of those crumbling wrecks of houses which 
 had so deceived me on my arrival. To my great surprise I found 
 well-provided shops under these ruins, stored with the most varied 
 fabrics from all parts of Europe and the Sudan, and contain- 
 ing every description of native product. We pursued the same 
 dilapidated road I had followed on the first day. Under the low 
 roof of a hut, open to the four winds, we found a tailor and his nine 
 workmen, whose needles were flying through blue-and-white stuffs, 
 while an old greybeard in spectacles read verses of the Koran to 
 them through his nose. Some were making pantaloons and the 
 ample robes of the Sudan, while others were ornamenting them 
 with elaborate Moorish embroideries. These embroidered robes 
 (Timbuctoo's chief industry) were notorious at the time of the 
 Sudanis greatest prosperity, and her workshops could barely keep 
 pace with the demand for them. They were exported to Morocco, 
 Bammaku, and Gao, and cost from three to four thousand francs 
 apiece. They are marvels of taste and delicate workmanship, 
 with roses and arabesques on the back and front, embroidered 
 in shining silken threads that stand out in brilliant whiteness 
 from the raw silk of the fabric. 
 
 Shoemakers formerly employed a similar art upon the wonder- 
 ful leather of the country, the true marocco, fine, supple, and 
 light, which is made into boots embellished with green and 
 yellow embroideries, and into slippers, cushions, and bindings. 
 We directed our steps towards a cracked and dilapidated house, 
 whose upper story had fallen into fragments. It was the abode 
 of a great merchant, and before its closed and barricaded door 
 my guide recited the accustomed discourse ; in spite of the several 
 months of our occupation, the old habits of precaution have not 
 entirely disappeared. Having passed the second armoured door, 
 we found ourselves in a courtyard shaded by a large verandah, 
 
262 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 whose arched galleries ran round its four sides, like the patio of 
 Spanish houses. Out in the streets the heat was terrific, but this 
 court was agreeably cool, with no trace of the external misery and 
 ruin. Everything was marvellously clean and well kept, and after 
 the Lasciate ogni speranza of the exterior it seemed a paradise. 
 
 Carpets and cushions were scattered about under the galleries, 
 for this court is the reception-room, and it is here that all business 
 is transacted. A panther skin was offered me for seat, and. >ve 
 were served with tea and sugar and the delicious dates of Tuat. 
 
 THE GARDENS OF TIMBUCTOO 
 
 After that we visited the shop, which ran across the entire house, 
 and in which sacks of millet were heaped upon sacks of rice, and 
 blocks of salt were to be counted by the hundreds. Bales of dates 
 lay side by side with packets of ostrich feathers and elephant 
 tusks. This house, outwardly a ruin, contained about fifty 
 thousand francs'-worth of merchandise. 
 
 Side by side with these unofficial are the official brokers or 
 taifa, who specialise in certain products, such as salt, gold, 
 
COMMERCE AND LIFE OF TIMBUCTOO 263 
 
 cattle and textiles. They go from house to house, offering 
 their services, showing samples, and explaining prices. On asking 
 the number of the specialists, I am told, 'There are about 
 three hundred who carry on the profession from father to son, 
 but all, even the women and children, are brokers in Timbuctoo.' 
 
 If he is provided with the necessary capital, and sees the 
 moment to be propitious, the native of Timbuctoo is not above 
 speculating on his own account, and his operations are very 
 similar to those of our Bourse. At certain periods of the year, 
 when the great caravans are expected, the rich merchants buy 
 up all the chief articles of commerce, salt, cereals and textiles, 
 thus causing an artificial rise in price, which they maintain until 
 their agent signals the approach of caravan or fleet. They also 
 buy large quantities of karita, kola nuts, onions, and other 
 stores, which are sold by children and slaves in the markets 
 and streets. 
 
 Falsification and fraud, as well as speculation, have long- 
 been known and practised in Timbuctoo. An old writing of 
 the time of Askia the Great devotes several pages to the denunci- 
 ation of false weights and measures, the admixture of copper 
 with virgin gold, the aeration of meat, and the baptism of 
 milk, etc. 
 
 It is sufficiently obvious that the great firms of Morocco, 
 Tuat, and Ghadames would, like Jenne and Sansanding, seek to 
 relieve themselves of the onerous intervention of the native 
 broker. All these towns, in fact, possessed property in Tim- 
 buctoo, and their representative, a relative or confidential slave, 
 was installed there, the heads of the firm paying an annual 
 visit in order to verify accounts and control the inventory. 
 Occasionally the merchants of north and south would establish 
 themselves in the city, returning to their native country as soon 
 
264 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 as their fortunes were made. All these people bought and sold 
 directly from the caravan. 
 
 The Arabian traders formerly constituted the most numerous, 
 enterprising, and richest element of the city. They introduced 
 a system of banking, and the traveller could procure from them 
 
 TRADERS FROM THE COUNTRY OF MOSSI 
 
 letters of credit for the whole of northern Africa. They also 
 gave credit to the dioulas, or travelling negro merchant. All 
 this required considerable courage, for there are no police in the 
 Sudan, and two or three years had often elapsed before they 
 saw their debtors again. Frequently they never reappeared at

 all, owing not so much to intentional dishonesty, as to the 
 numerous wars and the frequent insecurity of the different

 routes. The quarters occupied by the Arabs were called the 
 Baghinde, and the population, natives of Morocco, Tuat, and 
 
-J 
 
 266 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 Tripoli, formerly numbered about three hundred. They formed 
 a colony which was known by the name of 'the community of 
 white men, 1 and was analogous to the European colonies of 
 Eastern cities. They had a deputy at their head, occupying 
 a similar position to our consul, who was called ' head of the 
 whites, 1 and who was always a member of the town council. 
 On our entry into Timbuctoo, our officers found the 'head of 
 the whites 1 to be a Tripolitan named Milad. He was a man of 
 exceptional intelligence, and having had intercourse with Europeans 
 in his own country, he was enabled, by his advice and other 
 good offices, to give material assistance to our occupation. 
 
 Like the native population, this Arabian colony fell to pieces 
 under the unbearable tyranny of the Touaregs ; but for all that 
 it would be a mistake to suppose that Timbuctoo was ever a 
 very populous city. I should calculate the town to have pos- 
 sessed a population of only forty or fifty thousand inhabitants, 
 even at the time of its greatest splendour. The absence and 
 impracticability of any local industry explains a figure so incon- 
 siderable when compared with other great places of Mussulman 
 commerce, such as Cairo and Damascus, but sufficiently important 
 when we realise that the entire population lived by, and was 
 occupied with, commerce alone. 
 
 Seen in this light, the following figures will not be surprising. 
 In January 1895 the statistics show a turnover of 460,000 francs, 
 and at the time these figures were stated to me those who com- 
 puted them assured me that they hardly represented a third of 
 the actual sum. No serious effort has ever been made to obtain 
 an accurate knowledge of such things. The captain of the port 
 of Timbuctoo has not even an interpreter at his service. One 
 has to be satisfied with the voluntary declarations made by the 
 merchants to the military authorities and the native police super- 
 
COMMERCE AND LIFE OF TIMBUCTOO 267 
 
 intendents of Kabara and Timbuctoo. Even less than his Euro- 
 pean confrere does the African merchant like to let the whole 
 world into the secrets of his affairs. 
 
 It is necessary to mention the markets that since our occupa- 
 tion have been established by the timid or intractable upon the 
 Lower Niger. Two of these markets, viz. Keirago and Bamba, 
 
 
 GOLD MERCHANTS 
 
 now possess a traffic and population almost as important as those 
 of Timbuctoo itself. All these causes of fluctuation must be 
 taken into account before we can accurately estimate the capa- 
 bilities of Timbuctoo. I believe it will not be long before the 
 city will increase her annual commerce by twenty millions, that 
 is to say, double the amount computed in 1893 for the entire 
 colony of the French Congo. 
 
268 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 Not only was Timbuctoo the great commercial centre, it also 
 represented a city of pleasure to the whole of western Africa, 
 and especially to the Arabs. 
 
 I talked at Senegal with one of those Moorish traders who 
 form a very active and wealthy colony at St. Louis. Being en 
 route for Timbuctoo, I naturally did not forget to ask him what 
 he knew, or rather had heard, of the city, for he had never 
 visited it. ' Ah ! you are going to Timbuctoo ! ' he cried, with 
 sparkling eyes. ' Oh ! at Timbuctoo there are ladies, very many 
 and very beautiful ! ' To his mind the city seemed to represent 
 a gallant life rather than business. After gold, ivory, and ostrich 
 feathers, the principal attractions of Timbuctoo for the people 
 of the north are undoubtedly the easy manners prevailing in the 
 Sudan. This is also confirmed by ancient geographers. 
 
 Leon the African contents himself with saying, 4 The inhabi- 
 tants of Timbuctoo have gay natures, and dancing goes on every 
 evening until an advanced hour/ He was writing for the 
 Vatican, which may explain his reserve. Ibn Batouba is more 
 explicit. He observes on his arrival in the Sudan that ' these 
 people have very singular manners. The men are not in the 
 least jealous concerning their women-folk. The latter are not 
 at all embarrassed in the presence of a man ; and although they 
 are very devout in their prayers, they go about with unveiled 
 faces. They have friends and companions among the men, and 
 the men on their side have friends among the women. Thus it 
 often happens that a man, on returning home, finds his wife enter- 
 taining a friend. Having received permission from the kaid of 
 Oualata to visit him, I presented myself at his house one day, 
 and found him with a woman who was young and beautiful. I 
 was about to retire upon seeing her, when, without showing the 
 least shame, she went into fits of laughter at my embarrassment. 
 
COMMERCE AND LIFE OF TIMBUCTOO 269 
 
 " Do not go,"" said the kaid. " It is only a good friend of mine." 
 I was thunderstruck at seeing a jurisconsult, a scholar, and a man 
 who had made a pilgrimage to Mecca, behaving in such a manner. 
 I learned later that he had applied to the sultan for permission to 
 make the pilgrimage that same year in company with his good 
 friend ! Upon another occasion I visited a man, and found him 
 seated on a rug while his wife occupied a chair and was con- 
 versing with a man who was sitting beside her. " Who is that 
 woman ? " I asked. " She is my wife," he replied. " And who is 
 the man sitting beside her ? " " That is a friend of hers." " How 
 can you suffer such a thing ? " I indignantly asked ; " you who 
 have lived in our countries of the north, and know the rules of 
 the Koran." " With us," he replied, " women have friendships that 
 are in every way honourable, and no suspicion is ever aroused, for 
 our women are not like those of your country." I was so dis- 
 gusted by his folly that I instantly quitted his house, and have 
 never set foot in it again/ 
 
 It was towards 1350 that Ibn Batouba was so scandalised by 
 the manners of Oualata, and history has shown us that Timbuctoo 
 was developed by the immigration thither of the people of the 
 former town. Merchants and scholars would naturally import 
 their manners as well as their commerce, wealth, and science. 
 
 In a chapter entitled, ' All that I found of evil in the conduct 
 of the blacks, 1 the same author continues, ' The slaves, male and 
 female, and the young girls, appear in the streets quite nude. I 
 saw a great number thus even in the month of Ramadan. It 
 is the custom for all great personages to break their fast with 
 the sultan, and for this purpose they send parties of twenty or 
 more young slaves to carry the provisions to the palace. They 
 appear before the sultan quite nude, and his own daughters do the 
 same. The evening before Ramadan I saw several slaves with food 
 
270 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 leave the palace accompanied by two of the sultan's daughters, 
 and they likewise wore no clothes. ? 
 
 Ibn Batouba was a highly cultured man, as pious as he was 
 learned, and deeply imbued with the veiled manners of Islam. 
 Such customs could but shock and move to wrath a mind thus 
 educated, but their effect upon the vulgar, the merchants and their 
 clerks and camel-drivers, would probably be different. Bred in the 
 Arabian world, in which men and women lived absolutely separate 
 lives, and in which the latter disguise not only their form but even 
 their features under heavy draperies, the spectacle of such manners 
 must have been to them both novel and curious. They would not 
 experience the repulsion of the learned Ibn Batouba, but would mix 
 with this life and enjoy the new customs that in their own 
 countries would raise a blush to their cheeks. Timbuctoo would 
 soon be surrounded by a halo in their minds as being, upon 
 earth, one little corner of the paradise promised by Mahomet. 
 Askia the Great, having observed the Mohammedan practices of 
 Egypt, attempted several reforms. The women were compelled to 
 drape themselves from head to foot and adopt the life of the harem. 
 He also established a ' body of men charged to exercise a constant 
 surveillance, and to arrest and imprison any man found talking to 
 a strange woman after nightfall/ These measures fell into disuse 
 under the sons of the great king, and the manners of the country 
 relapsed into their accustomed freedom. 
 
 Ibn Batouba's description of Timbuctoo being amply sufficient, 
 I prefer to speak of the women of the city, that is to say, those of 
 its aristocratic families. By reason of continual intermarriage 
 with the Berber and Arab races, their features have become more 
 regular and considerably refined. Although they are black in 
 colour they approximate more to the Aryan type than the Negraic ; 
 the flatness of the nose and mouth is much less noticeable, and the 
 
A LADY OF TIMBUCTOO 
 
272 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 whole face is pleasantly lighted by wonderful eyes, whose gentle, 
 intelligent glance seems to enfold you. 
 
 These natural charms are supplemented by the arts of coquetry. 
 Their foreheads are charmingly adorned with bands of pearls and 
 sequins, and the most accomplished hairdressers arrange their 
 tresses in wonderful top-knots interspersed with ornaments of 
 golden filagree. Ear-rings of the sarfie precious metal dangle from 
 their ears, and necklaces of gold, coral, or amber are wound round 
 their throats; they also embellish their nails with henna and 
 darken their eyes with antimony. Above all, they know how to 
 drape themselves tastefully in the various kinds of stuff which 
 are to be found in Timbuctoo European, Arabian, and native 
 fabrics. 
 
 Unlike her negro sister, the woman of Timbuctoo plays the 
 part of great lady. She transfers the household work and the care 
 of her children to slaves, contenting herself with seeing that her 
 orders are carried out. She employs her time in reading and 
 playing upon the violin (whose sole string is made of camel's hair), 
 visiting her friends and smoking pipes, for no one is perfect. 
 
 Over, and above these mondaines, Timbuctoo possesses her 
 demi-mondaineSi who imitate the former in all things. The follow- 
 ing is an account of fashionable life given me by one of its 
 members : 
 
 * Business here allows of plenty of leisure; we have to wait until 
 certain articles have arrived, or until others have diminished or 
 risen in price. The stranger merchant, in order to amuse 
 himself, gathers his friends together at mid-day, or in the 
 evening by preference, and offers them a repast. They eat 
 fat sheep, pigeons, kuss-kuss, dates, kola nuts, wheaten biscuits, 
 and honey-cakes. They drink tea, and sometimes coffee. 
 Marabuts (to whom some present has been made beforehand) 
 
COMMERCE AND LIFE OF TIMBUCTOO 273 
 
 are invited, and delight the assembly with their old-world 
 histories. Each guest also tells some tale of his native country, 
 and it is by these means we know so well, not only what is passing 
 in Morocco, Tuat, and Tripoli, but all that is going on in Europe 
 and France also. These little fetes have become less frequent in 
 the present time of misfortune. Formerly one used to receive an 
 invitation nearly every day. Many Arabs from the north lived in 
 Timbuctoo then, and one might have built houses of lumps of 
 sugar, such great quantities of it were brought here by the cara- 
 vans. The people of Ghadames, Tunis, and Fez liked to 
 live well. They taught their slaves the art of preparing 
 very elaborate and varied dishes, pastries, and sweets ; 
 so much incense was burned and such great 
 quantities of attar of roses were 
 sprinkled about the houses that 
 you were seized with 
 headache on the 
 doorstep. 
 
 'The most 
 costly fetes were 
 those given to the 
 women. The people 
 of Jenne, Sansand- 
 ing, and Bammaku 
 rivalled the Arabs, 
 but the people of A BAKEHOUSE

 Tuat were the most 
 extragavant. On the other hand, the Mossi did not squander 
 their money in this fashion, but left the town as soon as their 
 business was concluded. 
 
 4 Those who had mistresses gave feasts which lasted many

 hours, much intoxicating liquid was. consumed, and the men became 
 as drunk as the idolatrous Bambarras. Musicians were sent for, 
 dancing began and was prolonged through the night. Men 
 would spend two or three hundred gold pieces in disputing a 
 mistress with a rival. A merchant of Sansanding is said to have 
 made his lady a present of five hundred blocks of salt. This 
 man lived near the mosque, and having passed the night in 
 feasting he wished to sleep during the day, and had the audacity 
 to say to the muezzin who calls the faithful to the five daily 
 prayers, " I am very tired, your voice will disturb me. If I do 
 not hear you throughout the day, I will make a rich offering to 
 the mosque. 11 
 
 'Many people who only came to stay a few weeks would pro- 
 long their visit for months and years, detained either by the 
 agreeable life of the town or some passion ; and many who arrived 
 with a fortune returned home ruined. 1 
 
CHAPTER XIII 
 
 THE UNIVEIISITY OF SANKORE 
 
 THE Queen of the Sudan would have been adorned with an 
 imperfect diadem if the crowning glory of Art had been wanting. 
 
 Insuperable objections prevented her possession of monuments. 
 Neither wood nor stone existed in her neighbourhood, not even 
 plaster was at her disposal, and the priceless clay of Jenne is not 
 to be found on the threshold of the desert. These facts are 
 sufficient excuse for my not giving a long account of the archi- 
 tecture of the great mosques of Timbuctoo (Gingharaber and 
 Sankore) and the oratory of Sidi Yaia. The dimensions of these 
 buildings greatly exceed those of the ordinary dwellings ; but a 
 mere collection of walls, more or less high, long and thick, can 
 scarcely be called a work of art, and nothing in these temples 
 recalls the happy decorative harmony of the old mosque of Jenne. 
 In a distant view of the city, their three minarets, looking like 
 abbreviated pyramids, represent their only interest. 1 
 
 Unable, therefore, to develop the sensuous arts, Timbuctoo 
 reserved all her strength for the intellectual, and here her 
 dominion was supreme. The city became the religious, scientific, 
 
 1 The King of Mali erected a palace at Timbuctoo in the fourteenth century. But 
 palaces have a precarious existence in the Sudan, and by the sixteenth century it 
 had disappeared. Its ruins, forming a compact hillock in the west of the town, are 
 now used as a slaughter-house. 
 
 275 
 
276 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 and literary centre of the Nigerian regions. 4 Salt comes from 
 the north, gold from the south, and silver from the country of 
 the white men, but the word of God and the treasures of wisdom 
 are only to be found in Timbuctoo,'' says an old Sudanese 
 proverb. 
 
 It would perhaps be an exaggeration to put the school of 
 Timbuctoo on a level with those of Syria, Spain, Morocco, and, 
 above all, Egypt ; for I must admit that I have not found among 
 her libraries any work equal in literary glory to those master- 
 pieces of the Arabian language and intellect the Hariri, the 
 Hamadani) or the Bedouin Kaisadas. For all that, Timbuctoo 
 was not merely the great intellectual nucleus of the Sudan, that 
 is to say, of the negroes she was also one of the great scientific 
 centres of Islam itself, her university being the younger sister of 
 those of Cairo, Cordova, Fez, and Damascus. Her collection of 
 ancient manuscripts leaves us in no doubt upon the point, and 
 permits us to reconstruct this side of her past in its smallest 
 details. 
 
 It is in Eastern Africa that the origin of the intellectual 
 glory of Timbuctoo must be sought, and it is to the Moors 
 that it must be attributed. We know that this fraction of the 
 Berber peoples adopted the religion of their Arabian conquerors, 
 and it was through the Moorish tribes who ranged along the 
 Atlantic coast that Islamism penetrated to the country of the 
 blacks in the ninth century. Wherever the Mussulman religion 
 found foothold it was invariably followed by the language of 
 the Koran and the Arabian sciences. The holy book contained, 
 or should contain, everything needful for a disciple of Mahomet. 
 It gave laws to man and regulated his faith, whether religious 
 or philosophical. The Koran was a code in which everything 
 
THE UNIVERSITY OF SANKORE 277 
 
 was decreed so much so, indeed, that to elucidate it was to 
 teach religion, philosophy, and law. Grammar and literature 
 were also founded on it, for they were taught on the lines of 
 the language employed by the editor of the holy book and 
 illustrated by examples taken from it. 
 
 Thus the Arabian language and culture spread over the 
 frontiers of the negro countries. Oualata, ' where the holiest 
 and most learned men resided,' became its bulwark ; and upon 
 the emigration of her people to Timbuctoo, the latter town 
 became the palladium of the faith. The Moorish poets and 
 scholars of Spain brought with them the harvests of Grenada 
 and Cordova. The caravans from the north spread abroad 
 the progress of Fez, Marrakesh, and Tunis ; and the annual 
 pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina proved the means of dissemi- 
 nating the many advantages of Cairo. Timbuctoo, more than any 
 other town, was enabled to profit by the conquests of Arabian 
 intellect and to collect and arrange large libraries. Market of 
 merchandise as she was, she also became the storehouse of the 
 Arabian language and science, spreading them afar with her 
 textiles and salt. 
 
 The confusion of tongues prevailing in the metropolis of 
 the Sudan necessitated a common language, and Songhois, 
 Foulbes, Toucouleurs, Touaregs, Bambarras, Mossi, Haouss- 
 ankas, Malinkas, etc., all used Arabic as the vehicle of a 
 mutual comprehension. 
 
 An entire class of the population was devoted to the study 
 of letters, being called fakirs or sheiks by the old manu- 
 scripts, and marabuts by the Sudanese of to-day. The first 
 term carries the meaning of jurist, 'those who know the law/ 
 and is interesting, as it proves that the scientific movement 
 originated from the study of the judicial principles contained 
 
278 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 in the Koran. The name sheik or marabut is preferable for 
 present use, as it signifies both priest and doctor, and therefore 
 better expresses the dual character of the Sudanese scholar. 
 
 The marabut is a man who, by his devotion to Islam and 
 his application of the duties indicated by the Koran, by his 
 profound knowledge of the holy writ, His learning and the 
 dignity of his personal life, sets an example to all true 
 believers. He belongs in general to a family which, so to 
 speak, makes a profession of devotion and science ; this twofold 
 reputation descends from father to son, and is sustained by 
 pilgrimages to the holy places and sojourns in the great 
 Arabian universities. We possess the biographies of several 
 hundreds of these learned men, and all are related to one 
 another in a more or less direct line. A cerebral refinement 
 was thus produced among a certain proportion of the negraic 
 population which has had surprising results, as we shall see 
 later, and which gives the categorical lie to the theorists who 
 insist upon the inferiority of the black races. 
 
 These pious and cultured families of Timbuctoo lived 
 within the precincts of the mosque of Sankore, and formed a 
 locality analogous to the Quartier Latin of Paris. They were 
 held in great esteem by both dignitaries and people. ' The 
 learned Ahmed (father to Ahmed Baba the writer) was 
 attacked by a dangerous illness. In order to render homage 
 to the merits and piety of this holy man, the sultan went 
 every evening to pass several hours by his bed of suffering, con- 
 tinuing this assiduity until the pious sheik was completely 
 recovered. 1 For a long time a portion of the taxes (the diaka 
 or tenth) was reserved for these marabuts. The Songhoi kings 
 pensioned the most celebrated, and they received many gifts, 
 especially in the month of Ramadan. They were intrusted 
 
280 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 with the education of children, and, to ensure them the tran- 
 quillity so necessary to the man of thought and letters, their 
 affairs were managed and their properties cultivated by their 
 slaves. 
 
 Each marahut followed his special vocation. Some confined 
 themselves to the study of religion and the service of God and 
 the mosque, others practised law, becoming magistrates or kadi, 
 and a great number consecrated their lives to the art of 
 teaching. It was not unusual to see two, or even all three, of 
 these professions united in one person, and the study of books 
 and the art of writing them were pursued by all. 
 
 Having already described the rich metropolis and the city 
 of pleasure, we will now, with the aid of the marabuts who 
 consecrated themselves to God, resuscitate that Holy City of 
 which the Tarik proudly says, 'Never has Timbuctoo been 
 sullied by the worship of idols nor by rendering homage to 
 any other deity than the merciful God. It is the dwelling-place 
 of wise men, the servants of the Most High, and the perpetual 
 habitation of saints and ascetics.' 
 
 The marabuts, under the direction of the Sheik ul Islam 
 and the imans, called the faithful to prayers, held public read- 
 ings of the sacred writings, and preached during the month of 
 Ramadan, the great Mussulman fast. Some, like the recluses 
 of the Thebaid, withdrew from the world and fasted incessantly. 
 They passed entire nights in prayer in the mosque, and were 
 full of care and pity for orphans. Others but let us rather 
 admire the perfect picture given in the original. 
 
 'The very learned and pious sheik, Abou Abdallah, had no 
 property, all his goods went to succour the poor and unhappy, and 
 he bought slaves that he might give them their liberty. His 
 
THE UNIVERSITY OF SANKORE 281 
 
 house had no door, every one entered unannounced, and men 
 came to see him from all parts and at all hours, especially on 
 Sundays after the two o'clock prayer. Moors and Arabs flocked 
 to him in crowds as soon as they learned his virtues/ 
 
 We might be reading the life of some Christian saint; and 
 numerous miracles are not lacking to complete the resemblance. 
 The following was accomplished by a marabut who lived some- 
 where about the year 1330 : ' The fakir El Hadj, grandfather of 
 the Kadi Abderrahman, was living in Bankou when the king of 
 Mali attacked that town. The people gathered round him before 
 going to battle, and he instructed them to eat of a certain herb. 
 With the exception of one man, all did as they were directed. 
 Then said El Hadj, "Go forth to battle, and the arrows of the 
 enemy shall have no power to hurt you." They all returned safe 
 and victorious, with the exception of the man who would not eat, 
 and he had died in the contest. 1 A no less extraordinary incident 
 happened to the great-great-grandfather of the celebrated writer 
 Ahmed Baba. 6 Being in Medina (Arabia), he asked permission to 
 visit the tornb of the Prophet. This grace being denied to him, he 
 sat down upon the threshold and recited the litanies of God's 
 elect. The door immediately opened of its own accord, and the 
 priests, amazed by this marvel, humiliated themselves before him 
 and kissed his hands.' 
 
 The life of Sidi Yaia, the patron of Timbuctoo, is particularly 
 full of miracles. One day, as he was holding an open-air reading 
 of the Koran, a cloud appeared overhead and rain fell. The rain 
 being followed by a clap of thunder, his disciples arose to seek 
 shelter. ' Remain in your places, 1 said Sidi Yaia, ' it will not 
 rain upon this spot.' And thus it happened.' The following 
 anecdote is equally remarkable : ' His female slaves wished to 
 cook a fish, and for a whole day they submitted it to the action of 
 
282 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 the fire without result. The women were astounded, but Sidi 
 Yaia, overhearing their talk, said to them, " As I went to pray 
 in the mosque this morning my foot touched something moist ; it 
 was probably your fish, for that which my body has touched fire 
 has no power to burn ! " 
 
 Miracles being so plentiful, it will surprise no one to learn 
 that the marabuts were on equally familiar terms with prophecies 
 and visions. The departure from Marrakesh of the Moorish army 
 which was to conquer the Sudan was announced on the same day 
 to the people of Timbuctoo by the fakir Abderrahman. 
 ' After reciting the morning prayer," says the Tarik^ ' he invoked 
 the name of Allah three times, and said, " This year thou shalt 
 hear many things, the like of which thou hast never heard, and 
 thou shalt see many things, the like of which thou hast never 
 seen!" 1 
 
 In the early part of Sidi Yaia^s life, Mahomet was wont to 
 appear to him every night, but as he grew older these visits became 
 less frequent, until finally the Prophet only appeared to him once 
 a year. When asked the reason of this remissness, Sidi Yaia 
 replied, ' The only reason which occurs to me is, that formerly I 
 paid no attention to trade, and now I devote a good deal of 
 time to it." 'But why do you do so? 1 'Because I have no 
 wish to be dependent on others, 1 answered the saint. 
 
 Mohammed Neddo, who governed Timbuctoo in the name of 
 the Touaregs shortly before its conquest by Sunni Ali, was on 
 very intimate terms with Sidi Yaia. Towards the end of his life 
 it was shown to Neddo in a dream that though the sun had set 
 the moon had not risen. This portentous vision was imparted to 
 his friend, who said, 'Art thou afraid to learn the meaning of 
 this dream ? ** 'I am not afraid, 1 was the reply. ' It signifies, then, 
 that I shall die very soon, and that you will die shortly after. 1 
 
THE UNIVERSITY OF SANKOR^ 283 
 
 Neddo was overcome with sadness. ' Art thou afraid ?' asked Sidi 
 Yaia. ' This sadness is not caused by fear of death, 1 answered 
 Neddo, 'but by the great love I bear for my little children." 
 6 Confide them to God, 1 said the prophet. Sidi Yaia died shortly 
 after this, and Neddo soon followed him, and was buried by the 
 side of his friend in the mosque he had built. 
 
 The marks of divine favour by which Allah distinguished his 
 marabuts from other believers were even manifested after death. 
 A certain sheik had given instructions that only one of his 
 disciples should be permitted to prepare his funeral toilet. When 
 the time came the disciple found a lighted taper by the side of the 
 corpse. He commanded that it should be extinguished and the 
 grave-clothes brought. When the winding-sheet was spread over 
 the body it immediately gave forth such a marvellous light that 
 the whole chamber was illuminated by it. 
 
 The old chronicles relate a thousand incidents as remarkable in 
 every way as those I have just quoted. A learned doctor of 
 Timbuctoo was justified in saying, 'The holy men of this city were 
 not surpassed in piety by the companions of the Prophet." These 
 pious individuals were called Oualiou, and men of evil life, who 
 found their last moments full of the fear of the Lord, requested 
 that they might be buried near these saints, in order that the 
 departed should intercede for them with the Most High. Pilgrim- 
 ages were made to their houses and their gardens. Miracles were 
 asked for, and granted, because well, because there is no 
 reason why they should not be granted when asked for by true 
 believers. 
 
 North, south, east, and west of the town, upon the crests of 
 the dunes, are built the little chapels which mark their graves and 
 form a rampart of sanctity round the city. Wishing to visit 
 these dunes, in memory of the charming tales which had grown 
 
284 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 out of the dust of those who slept there, my servant and I sallied 
 forth one morning, with Winchesters duly charged in readiness for 
 the Touaregs. Scarcely a dozen of these edicules are still standing 
 under the sickly shade cast by a few of the consumptive trees of 
 the desert. We found an old man before one of them, a marabut 
 of the present who had come to visit his brothers of the past. 
 He had opened the door of one of the little chapels, and its 
 interior showed a small clay mound covered with pieces of a 
 coarse stuff. Sitting on the threshold, the old man quavered a 
 few verses from the Koran. 
 
 It was the only sound we heard, and he was the only living 
 being we met in the white furnace of the sands, the vast field 
 of death which surrounds the city. At every step the foot knocked 
 against some skull, tibia, or even an entire skeleton, the remains 
 of bygone generations, and of corpses confided yesterday to the 
 inconstant sands, and disinterred to-day by the wild beasts of 
 the desert. The sternness and sterility of the desert, and the 
 
 
 
 THE TOMBS SURROUNDING TIMBUCTOO 
 
 accumulated death encircling me, recalled the vision of the Valley 
 of Jehoshaphat spreading before the walls of Jerusalem the Holy, 
 whose soil, like this, produces only an efflorescence of death. 
 
THE UNIVERSITY OF SANKOR^ 285 
 
 The marabuts, who devoted themselves to the study of law, 
 administered justice according to the precepts of the Koran and 
 the decisions contained in the most important works of the 
 Arabian jurists. They also made inventories of property, deter- 
 mining its succession, and generally filling the position of lawyer. 
 
 The scholars of Timbuctoo yielded in nothing to the saints 
 and their miracles. During their sojourns in the foreign uni- 
 versities of Fez, Tunis, and Cairo, ' they astounded the most 
 learned men of Islam by their erudition." That these negroes 
 were on a level with the Arabian savants is proved by the fact 
 that they were installed as professors in Morocco and Egypt. In 
 contrast to this we find that the Arabs were not always equal to 
 the requirements of Sankore. 'A celebrated jurist of Hedjaz 
 (Arabia), arriving in Timbuctoo with the intention of teaching, 
 found the town full of Sudanese scholars. Observing them to be 
 his superiors in knowledge, he withdrew to Fez, where he suc- 
 ceeded in obtaining employment.'' 
 
 The profession of teaching was absolutely free, its only qualifi- 
 cation consisting of a sufficiently large audience. If one may 
 believe their biographies, these masters were of rare merit, full 
 of kindliness and goodwill towards their pupils, and keenly alive 
 to the responsibilities of their position. They would refuse the 
 exalted and lucrative post of iman in order to continue their 
 profession. One of them ' multiplied obstacles to avoid being 
 made Grand Kadi/ 
 
 The following is a description of the daily occupations of 
 Mohammed ben Abou Bakr, one of the most respected scholars 
 of his day: 6 He gave lectures on different subjects from early 
 morning until ten o'clock. After returning home for prayer he 
 went to the kadi to settle the affairs of his clients and act as 
 mediator between disputants. He recited the midday prayer in 
 
286 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 public, and taught in his own house until three o'clock ; he then 
 said the prayer of asr, and went out to teach in a different 
 place until dusk, and after sunset he gave a final lecture in the 
 mosque.** 
 
 Here is the portrait of a professor of whom it was written, 
 
 TOMB OF A SAINT 
 
 4 The Sudan did not possess another as learned and pious/ He 
 was endowed with every imaginable gift, and was, in fact, none 
 other than Sidi Yaia himself, the patron of Timbuctoo ; and we 
 shall see him under the triple aspect of saint, kadi, and scholar : 
 4 He was gifted with a calm intelligence which was only 
 equalled by his infallible memory. His science was universal, 
 his whole personality commanded respect and obedience, and 
 many men owned no other rule of conduct than the precepts 
 which fell from his lips. People came in crowds to ask his 
 blessing, bringing with them gifts of considerable value. He 
 received all these visitors with great modesty, and invariably 
 gave their presents away to others. On being elected kadi he 
 abolished many of the abuses and corrupt practices of the tribunal, 
 and was a model of equity in the eyes of all true believers. The 
 
THE UNIVERSITY OF SANKOR^ 287 
 
 pressing duties of magistracy in no way abated his ardour for 
 teaching, and by his eloquence he charmed all who listened to 
 him. What clearness of explanation ! How sure and easy a 
 guide was his method ! Such an intellect was surely created to 
 revolutionise ! ' Sidi Yaia, in fact, resuscitated the sciences in the 
 negro countries, and instructed many young men who afterwards 
 distinguished themselves in letters. His life was as long as it was 
 useful; he lived to the age of eighty-seven (1373-1462), and was 
 employed in teaching during fifty of those years. 
 
 It would be superfluous to insist that these learned men must 
 have possessed marvellous libraries, for their catalogues are men- 
 tioned by the Sudanese authors. Religious, judicial, and gram- 
 matical works occupy the first place. They consist of collections 
 of traditions concerning the Prophet, such as the Sahih of Bokhari, 
 the Djana of Essoyouti, the Sahih of Moslem, and the Sogra, in 
 which the author says that, having been transported to Paradise, 
 he saw Abraham engaged in teaching little children and setting 
 them copies to write. The Alfyga is a grammatical treatise, and 
 the Chemail of Termedi contains a description of the qualities 
 of the Prophet, his private life and policy. Finally, works on 
 law are represented by the doctrines of the sect of Iman Malek, 
 including the numerous commentaries to which they gave birth, 
 the abridgment of Sidi Khalil, the Risala of Abou - Zaid of 
 Kairwan, etc. 
 
 Poetry and works of imagination are not lacking, nor com- 
 positions of a kind peculiar to Arabian literature ; such as the 
 Hariri and Hamadani. I found a copy of the Choice of 
 Marvels, composed at Mossul by the learned Abu Abdallah ben 
 Abderrahim of Grenada in the year 1160. The historical and 
 geographical works of Morocco, Tunis, and Egypt were well known 
 in Timbuctoo (Ibn Batouba being often quoted), and the pure 
 
288 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 sciences were represented by books on astronomy and medicine. 
 In short, the libraries of Timbuctoo may be said to have included 
 almost the whole of Arabian literature. 
 
 Amongst other trades, the city made a speciality of manu- 
 scripts. 'Books sell very well there," said Leon the African, 
 4 and a greater profit is to be made out of them than out of any 
 other merchandise. 1 The learned doctors were, to use an expres- 
 sion which may appear strange when applied to negroes, biblio- 
 philes. In the best sense of the word, be it understood ; they had 
 no mania for collecting uncut books and bindings, but were true 
 lovers of books. We see them ' searching with a real passion for 
 volumes they did not possess,' and making copies when they were 
 too poor to buy what they wanted. They would in this manner 
 collect from seven hundred to two thousand volumes; and in 
 marked contrast to the miserly book-lovers of our day, these 
 bibliophiles experienced a real joy in sharing their most precious 
 manuscripts with others. 6 Abou Bakr loved the friends of science, 
 and paid them every sort of attention. He would lend them his 
 most cherished books and never ask for them back again, however 
 rare they might be. He lavished his entire library in this manner 
 (may Allah reward him !) ; the student who came to his door to 
 borrow was never denied, and this is the more remarkable, as 
 he was passionately devoted to books, and would only obtain 
 his reward in heaven/ 
 
 The libraries of Timbuctoo were sadly reduced by the pillage 
 of the Foulbes and Toucouleurs. At the present time the mara- 
 buts and kadis are best provided, but every wealthy inhabitant 
 prides himself upon the possession of a few books. He does not 
 often read them, it is true, but he likes to show them, which, to 
 him, is almost as good. 
 
 In spite of this I found it very difficult to procure any books 
 
THE UNIVERSITY OF SANKORfi 289 
 
 in the early part of my stay. They were afraid I should practise 
 the nefarious customs of the Toucouleurs and Foulbes. After I 
 had gained some credit among them, a few solitary pages were 
 lent to me, and when they saw that I treated them tenderly and 
 faithfully returned them, they decided to trust me with whole 
 volumes. I never succeeded in inducing any of them to sell me a 
 book, however much I offered for it, and had to content myself 
 with copying all that seemed interesting to me. One man told 
 me the history of a unique volume which he had parted with to 
 a merchant from the south, and had regretted ever since. He had 
 received forty gros of gold for it, which, at the rate often francs a 
 gros, represents a respectable sum for a book, even in France. 
 
 From the masters we will turn to the pupils. These flocked to 
 the city from all sides, from the desert, Morocco, and all parts of 
 the Sudan. Jenne and the secondary intellectual circles, such as 
 Tindirma, Dia, Sa, Korienza, etc., served as preparatory schools 
 for Timbuctoo. The sons of the Songhoi kings quitted the palaces 
 of Gao, and the children of the Touaregs deserted their great tents 
 to receive an education at the University of Sankore. The Tarik 
 mentions this interesting fact: 'One of the Askia, Mohammed 
 Bankouri, collected an army with which to dispute the supreme 
 power with a king proclaimed at Gao. Pausing at Timbuctoo, 
 and having conversed with the Grand Kadi, he requested him to 
 write a letter to his rival, saying that he, Bankouri, renounced 
 the throne that he might follow the life of a student in this city 
 of books/ Side by side with princes and sons of chieftains 
 came poor wretches, eager for knowledge, who were supported by 
 the dignitaries of the town, and by those merchants who liked to 
 play the role of Maecenas. 
 
 The student or Tdliba arrives armed with the groundwork of 
 
290 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 instruction ; some small marabut of his native country having 
 taught him to read and write. It is a picture one constantly sees 
 in the Sudan. In the shade before the schoolmaster's house, a 
 collection of children are gathered together in the coolest corner. 
 Arranged in circles and sitting on their heels, they repeat verses of 
 the Koran in chorus, following the inflections, marking the pauses, 
 
 A SCHOOL AT JENNE 
 
 and imitating the tone indicated to them. They learn to form 
 the Arabic characters by copying a page of the holy book on the 
 wooden tablets which take the place of the too costly paper. From 
 time to time the tablet is washed and set in the sun to dry, after 
 which it is again ready for use. 
 
 Heading and writing being accomplished, the master delivers 
 a grammatical and exegetical explanation of the text. He either 
 takes the words one by one, or grouped in sentences, and dis- 
 courses on the rules of syntax, explains the meaning of the 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 passage, and adds some religious or historical reflections. When 
 the entire Koran has been gone through, the parents, who have 
 offered weekly presents of cowries or in kind, make a final and 
 more extensive present to the professor, and invite him to a little 
 jete given to their friends and acquaintances. 
 
 The young man is now prepared for the reading of works of 
 greater importance of another kind. I say 'reading' designedly, 
 for Arabian instructions consist less of lessons ex professo than 
 of the explanation of books. 
 
 Thus prepared, the Taliba sets out for Timbuctoo, and there 
 he usually studies under several masters, each of whom makes a 
 speciality of elucidating some particular work. He goes from 
 one to another, according to their merits or the dictates of his 
 own fancy. The lessons are given under the arcades of the mosque 
 of Sankore, or in the court or gardens of the teacher's house. 
 
 The branches of instruction were many and various. The 
 theologians commented upon and analysed the great sacred 
 books, and taught rhetoric, logic, eloquence, and diction in order 
 to prepare the student to spread abroad the words of God and 
 maintain controversies. The jurist expounded the law according 
 to the Malakite dogmas, and the stylists taught the art of writing 
 4 in ornamental terms/ Others professed grammar, prosody, philo- 
 logy, astronomy, and ethnography ; and others again were ' very 
 versed in the traditions, biographies, annals, and histories of man- 
 kind. 1 Mathematics do not appear to have formed a special 
 course ; and as for medicine, the grossest empiricism was mingled 
 with the hygienic principles of the therapeutic Arab. A certain 
 sheik is shown curing a toothache ' with a little earth from his 
 garden,' and, worse than that, 4 a great personage having been 
 attacked* by leprosy, doctors came from all parts of Africa to pre- 
 scribe for him. One of them said, " He can only be cured by 
 
THE UNIVERSITY OF SANKOR^ 
 
 eating the heart of a young man." The emir instantly ordered 
 one to be killed, but it did no good, and the great personage died 
 of his disease.'' 
 
 A SCHOOL- 
 
 These studies were exceedingly long. ' We were three years 
 over the explanation of the Teshil of the Iman Malek before we 
 acquired a thorough mastery of the subtleties of the Arabian 
 language,' says a writer of Timbuctoo. Physical education, on 
 
294 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 the other hand, was grossly neglected. Even in the time of Sunni 
 Ali the children were forbidden to play or practise bodily exercises. 
 When the learned men, pursued by the tyrant, were obliged to 
 quit Timbuctoo, ' they did not know how to mount a camel, and 
 fell miserably to the ground. ** 
 
 The students, having completed their education, receive a 
 diploma or licence to teach. They are now marabuts in their 
 turn, and all the liberal careers of the Sudan are open to them. 
 They can enter the mosques and become imans or preachers 
 in some small town, or they can aspire to the position of kadi, or 
 assistant-kadi, in their own country. Some adopt the careers 
 of their masters and found fresh families of sheiks. 
 
 Rich merchants often take one of these young men into their 
 household, where he plays a part analogous to that formerly 
 occupied by the chaplain in European families. He occupies 
 himself with the education of the children, reads aloud to the 
 head of the family, and writes his letters. He also gives his 
 opinion on matters of hygiene and morality, superintends the 
 merchant's charities, and tells him amusing stories. Other Talibas 
 gain a livelihood by giving lessons in the Arabian language and 
 writing to the negro strangers passing through Timbuctoo. A 
 great number fill the office of public scribe, and undertake the 
 correspondence of different merchants ; they also copy books, for 
 which they are paid from fifteen to one hundred francs, according 
 to the importance of the work. 
 
 Thieves and hypocrites may also be counted among their 
 numbers. These exploit the credulous and cultivate superstition 
 among the people, reducing Islamism to the level of the fetich- 
 worship and the practice of magic, brought from Egypt by the 
 ancestors of the Songhois. They will prepare noxious potions for 
 a consideration, and hold somnambulistic consultations. They fore- 
 
THE UNIVERSITY OF SANKORE 295 
 
 tell the failure or success of a journey or enterprise, manufacture 
 talismans, and profess to cast spells. The traffic of talismans or 
 grls-gris is particularly lucrative, their principal clients being 
 Touaregs and negroes. These grls-gris consist of prayers or 
 invocations, written on a morsel of stuff and sewn up in a leathern 
 bag. They are suspended from the walls of houses to keep away 
 demons and djinns, and to serve as a protection against enemies. 
 Certain rigmaroles read on a Monday or a Friday will protect 
 travellers on their journeys. I have even discovered a ' recipe 
 for driving away locusts." Here it is : 6 Any one desiring this, 
 should write upon four sheets of paper the prayer I have com- 
 posed, and place one in each corner of his field. He must then 
 take a yellow and a red locust and pronounce the first verse of 
 my prayer seven times, after which he must say, " O Locust, 
 if thou and thy companions do not quit this field, thou shalt be 
 charged with the abominable sin of him who hath relations with 
 mother and daughter." ' 
 
 A learned man of great celebrity, El Moucheili, wrote a book 
 on these charlatans, entitled, 'Advice to honest people against 
 allowing themselves to be duped by pretended marabuts.' 
 
CHAPTER XIV 
 
 POLITICS AND LITERATURE 
 
 NOT content with being priests, magistrates, and scholars, the 
 marabuts further extended their influence over the domains of 
 politics and literature. 
 
 We have shown great and small hastening to the dwellings 
 of these learned men to seek counsel and consolation from their 
 holiness and wisdom, and in this manner the marabuts accustomed 
 themselves to giving advice without always waiting to be asked 
 for it. These pious and wise men ' remonstrated, sometimes 
 severely, with people of all classes, even princes.' Kadi El Akib, 
 for example, ' possessed a mixture of firmness and independence 
 which raised him above all prejudices; he expressed his opinion 
 to the sultan with the same frankness he employed to his humblest 
 subject. When he observed anything in his sovereign's conduct 
 that was reproved by the Law of the Prophet" (nota bene, it is 
 always possible to find a text in the Law of the Prophet which 
 will command or forbid anything, no matter what), ' he would 
 resign his post and retire to his house/ Thus the marabuts 
 glided into the dangerous path of politics. 
 
 Their intrusion into the political world soon led to their being 
 regarded with grave suspicion, and finally caused their fall. As 
 we have seen, the soldierly fist of Sunni Ali weighed heavily upon 
 those who opposed him.

 The marabuts regained their lost ground, however, under the 
 Askias. The founder of the dynasty, whether from conviction or 
 expediency, showed himself their ardent and untiring friend, 
 and we have seen them lending devoted support to the usurper 
 in return, and legitimising with sacred texts his assumption of the 
 throne. They were kept constantly about his person, and he 
 consulted them in everything, even asking their advice in matters 
 of war. He appealed to them in all legal affairs, and treated them, 
 in short, as his ministers. A pamphlet of the period, found in a 
 library at Timbuctoo, describes the part played by the marabuts. 
 Its author is not a Sudanese, but is one of those Arabian doctors 
 who travelled about the Sudan in the reign of the famous monarch, 
 and whose description is unfortunately still wanting. The very 
 original character of El Moucheili may serve to fill the blank, 
 perhaps. 
 
 Born in Tlemcen in Algeria, ' he combined a remarkable intel- 
 ligence," says his biographer, ' with a passion for study, and was 
 distinguished as much by his piety as his erudition." Of a bold 
 and enterprising disposition, and filled with zeal for the Koran, he 
 devoted all his knowledge and energies to the cause of fanaticism. 
 Having gained considerable influence with the Assembly of Notables 
 during his sojourn in the confederation of Tuat, he urged them to 
 a persecution of the Jews. Not content with degrading and 
 depriving these people of their privileges, he incited the populace 
 to massacre them and destroy their synagogues. The Grand Kadi 
 of the Republic highly disapproved of this violence, and the 
 ulemas of Fez, Tunis, and Tlemcen were consulted on the question. 
 Two of them defended El Moucheili, and one of them drew up a 
 long memorial on the legitimacy of intolerance, addressing the 
 hero of Tuat in the following words : ' All honour to our brother 
 the zealous doctor, who alone had courage in these times of cor- 
 
POLITICS AND LITERATURE 299 
 
 ruption to proclaim his faith in open day, to resist abuses, and to 
 arouse lukewarm souls to the true religion. It is a glory to 
 him to have opposed with such energy the enterprises of the 
 Jews (whom may God crush with His scorn !). He only has been 
 found sufficiently faithful to awaken the people whom worldly 
 interest has made deaf to the voice of the Prophet/ On the 
 reception of this letter El Mouche'ili announced the triumph of 
 his opinions to his partisans and commanded the destruction of 
 the synagogue. He put a price upon the Jews, and paid seven 
 mitkals (ninety francs) a head for them out of his own purse. 
 The massacre which followed obliged him to quit the country 
 and seek refuge in the heart of the Sudan, where he found shelter 
 and a position in the court of Askia the Great. 
 
 The Songhoi king asked him seven questions on the subject of 
 the reforms then occupying his mind, viz. the regulation of com- 
 mercial transactions, the suppression of fraud, the establishment 
 of the tax on land, the tithe upon newly conquered countries, the 
 question of inheritance, and the measures to be taken to ensure 
 morality and good manners among the Sudanese. 
 
 The pamphlet in my possession contains these questions and 
 the answers made to them by the Arabian sheik, which are treated 
 as carrying all the force of law. El Mouche'ili counsels, among 
 other things, the creation of inspectors of markets and manners, 
 and the verification of weights and measures. Besides these 
 excellent reforms, he suggested the adoption of measures which 
 are in every way regrettable, bearing as they do the imprint of 
 the severity and intolerance of which he had given ample evidence 
 in his campaign against the Jews of Tuat. He advocated the most 
 stringent regulations, generally accompanied by a death penalty, 
 and always based upon the most judicial and religious arguments. 
 
 This excessive zeal and the great influence El Mouche'ili 
 
300 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 exercised over the Sudan (he is still an authority there) leads 
 us to a subject upon which hitherto we have not had occasion to 
 touch, but which, nevertheless, is of considerable importance, viz. 
 the psychology of the Mussulman negro. 
 
 The character of the Sudanese in general, and the Songhoi in 
 particular, is essentially based upon a foundation of goodness and 
 docility, and they lack the / elements necessary to pro- 
 duce the savage sectarian Jji^ so common to the north of 
 Africa and Asia. The MvL Sudanese generally adopted 
 
 ~~^ ***'' 
 
 THE GRAND MOSQUE OF TIMBUCTOO 
 
 the religion of Mahomet out of pure snobbishness, because their 
 conquerors professed it, and it reflected some prestige upon them 
 and gave them a claim to consideration. Once under European 
 rule, therefore, there would be no impediment to their conversion 
 to Christianity. Left to themselves, they form the type of the 
 tolerant Mussulman. Five centuries after the introduction of 
 Islamism into the Sudan we still find the fetichist's temple standing 
 side by side with the mosque, even in great centres like Jenne, 
 where the idolatrous altars were not destroyed until 1475. Among 
 
POLITICS AND LITERATURE 301 
 
 the numerous biographies of the saints I have never seen the 
 intolerance of these pious individuals boasted of nor even men- 
 tioned. In a general way, the tepid fervour of the populace is 
 tainted by the naive scepticism displayed by Sunni AH in the 
 very typical incidents I have already described. They seldom 
 observe the fast of Ramadan in all its rigour, and I have mentioned 
 the consumption of intoxicating liquids once or twice before. 
 Circumcision and the daily prayers constitute, in fact, their 
 principal observances of the Mohammedan religion. 
 
 Contemporary history of the Sudan has, however, revealed 
 frequent fanatical explosions and numerous holy wars. The 
 curious biography of El Moucheili has disclosed one of the causes 
 of these disturbances, namely, the influence of the Arabian Mus- 
 sulman, which at the present moment principally makes itself felt 
 by the propaganda of the sect of the Snoussi. Another fruitful 
 cause is to be found in the pilgrimages to Mecca. It is, there- 
 fore, through direct, or indirect, contact with the foreign Mus- 
 sulman of the white races that the Sudanese is transformed into 
 a sectarian, and it is from this contact that we must preserve 
 him in order to maintain peace in the Nigerian countries. 
 
 Finally, and most characteristically, it is not the pure-bred negro 
 among the populations of the Sudan who allows himself to be led 
 into holy wars, but it is those people in whose veins the blood of 
 the white races flows, the Foulbes of Berber origin, and the Tou- 
 couleurs, who are a mixture of the Foulbe and the negro of Mali. 
 
 Among the Sudanese marabuts noted as the ministers of Askia 
 the Great, Mohaman Koti, or Koutou, deserves special notice. 
 With him we shall have occasion to speak of the literary produc- 
 tions of the Sudan, for among the Nigerian writers worthy of 
 attention he is the first in date. 
 
302 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 According to some he was a, Malinka, according to others a 
 Songhoi born at Karamiou. His education, begun at Tindirma, 
 was completed at Timbuctoo, and he became the most esteemed 
 and even tyrannical counsellor of the great king. His authority 
 originated in the following manner. Askia one day distributed 
 some dried dates among his retinue, and Koti, newly arrived at 
 the court, was somehow overlooked. Shortly afterwards the 
 learned doctor assembled his pupils and dispensed fresh dates 
 among them. This miracle for the Sudan does not produce 
 dates having reached the ears of the king, he immediately dis- 
 cerned that Koti was marked with the divine seal. From that 
 moment Askia gave him all his confidence, and bestowed so much 
 wealth upon him that he was free to devote himself entirely to 
 literature. 
 
 The Sudanese doctors were enabled to add the works of their 
 own authors to the books of Bagdad, Cairo, and Grenada, which 
 formed the foundations of their libraries. These writings were 
 almost invariably of a serious kind, scholastic and judicial treatises, 
 and the greater part of their productions are entirely without 
 interest to us. A fraction of it, on the other hand, is of the 
 highest importance, and contains those historical works which shed 
 so much light upon the obscure past of these vast regions. 
 
 Under the title of the Fatassi, Koti edited a history of the 
 kingdoms of Ganata, Songhoi, and Timbuctoo, from their origins 
 to the year 1554 (950 of the Hegira). In spite of the most per- 
 sistent research, I have not been able to procure more than 
 fragments of this important work. Every one knows all about it, 
 but no one possesses it; it is the phantom book of the Sudan. 
 
 Koti was born in 1460, and as he survived Askia the Great 
 by fourteen years-, and was connected with all the public affairs, 
 his account of this brilliant epoch of the Sudan would be of 
 
POLITICS AND LITERATURE 303 
 
 inestimable value. The fragments we have discovered amply prove 
 this, and their extreme interest greatly augments our regrets. 
 4 Perhaps you will find a complete copy at Dia or Korienza, 1 they 
 told me. But all I could discover was one of the descendants of 
 the historian, named Ahmadou Sansarif, who exercised the func- 
 tions of kadi at Timbuctoo. He was very well informed, and 
 revised the manuscripts which had been copied for me, and these 
 are the facts he imparted concerning the great work of his 
 progenitor : 
 
 4 The Fatassi has never been so well known as the other histories 
 of the Sudan because it dealt with the concerns of many peoples 
 and many men. Families, since grown rich and powerful, and the 
 chiefs of various countries, were shown with very humble origins, 
 sometimes being the offspring of slaves. The book caused great 
 annoyance to many people on this account, and those interested 
 bought all the copies they could procure and destroyed them. 
 The original manuscript, however, had been transmitted to our 
 family. One of my great-aunts, living in Tindirmah, had inherited 
 it, and guarded it jealously. To avoid unpleasantness, and at the 
 same time preserve the book from destruction, she had it placed 
 in a wooden box and buried under a hillock close to her house. 
 My aunt was a widow, and among other charms she possessed the 
 gift of conversation. Her house was the centre of frequent gather- 
 ings, and when she was asked, "What is this mound in your garden?" 
 she always replied, 44 It is Ahmadou Koti, my venerable ancestor, 
 who is buried there.*" Her friends never failed to say a short 
 prayer over the mound, for Koti had left a great reputation for 
 piety and wisdom behind him. A Foulbe succeeded in becoming 
 so intimate with my aunt that she imparted her secret to him. 
 He immediately quitted Tindirma and went to his king, Cheikou 
 Ahmadou, to reveal to him the existence of a complete copy of 
 
304 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 the Fatassi. Shortly afterwards the king sent a troop of soldiers 
 to dig up the mound and discover its precious treasure ; but as 
 they were returning to Hamadallai the bearer of the priceless 
 volume capsized his canoe, and the book was lost to the world 
 for ever. 1 
 
 We have seen that, in order to legitimise his holy war and his 
 conquests, Cheikou Ahmadou gave himself out to be the twelfth 
 Khalif, and rested the pretension upon an obvious fabrication pro- 
 fessing to be taken from the Fatassi. Is it not likely that the 
 Foulbes organised the persecution of the book with the intention 
 of destroying the proofs of their king's trickery ? 
 
 The political influence of the marabuts steadily increased under 
 the successors of Askia the Great, and we have shown them 
 remonstrating with the unnatural sons of the unhappy old man. 
 The turn taken by their authority is interesting and unexpected, 
 for it represents what we to-day call c public opinion,* 1 and we are 
 about to see the Songhoi kings showing themselves singularly 
 susceptible to its influence. 
 
 ' The king, Askia Moussa," relates the Tarik^ ' having been 
 defeated in the countries of Lake Chad and obliged to take to 
 flight with his army, said to his generalissimo, " In spite of all the 
 anguish of defeat, it is less painful to me to endure than is the 
 thought of what will pass in Timbuctoo when the news of my 
 disaster reaches there. The agitators will gather together behind 
 the mosque of Sankore and say, Young men, have you heard 
 what is passing in Kanta ? The king has been forced to fly lest 
 he and his army should perish. They whom he has fought would 
 annihilate him ! I can hear them as plainly as though I were 
 there." 1 
 
 Other anecdotes show us the marabuts treating the royal

 authority with a freedom which savours of insolence. The 
 sovereigns, on the other hand, display a great lack of spirit, and by 
 the sixteenth century the pious scholars have become a politically 
 dangerous and turbulent element. 
 
 It was this which brought upon them the Moorish exile ; their 
 
 BEHIND THE MOSQUE OF SANKORE 
 
 conquerors, although Mussulmans, soon saw that the mosque con- 
 stituted their sole danger. It was undoubtedly at the instigation 
 of the marabuts that Timbuctoo revolted against the foreign 
 garrison, and the pasha Mahmoud employed a soldier's method 
 (that is to say, a radical one) of quelling these priests. He arrested 
 a great number of them, with their families, and despoiled them or 
 their wealth, which had become considerable. A certain propor- 
 
 z 
 
306 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 tion were massacred, and the rest, after five months 1 imprisonment, 
 were exiled to Morocco (1594). 
 
 Their misfortunes surpassed those endured by their ancestors 
 under Sunni Ali, for they were dragged in chains through the 
 desert and incarcerated at Marrakesh. Though they had abused 
 their power in the days of prosperity, they did not succumb to 
 the blows of adversity. So far from humiliating themselves before 
 their merciless conquerors, the firm and haughty demeanour they 
 maintained excites our admiration. One of them, finding death to 
 be near, charged his companions to deliver a sealed letter to the 
 sultan, which contained these words : ' Thou art the oppressor and 
 I am the oppressed, but oppressor and oppressed alike shall stand 
 before the Eternal Judge. 1 
 
 However regrettable this exile may be from its consequences' 
 to the Sudan, it does not lack great historical interest. It is the 
 touchstone which enables us to test the eulogies concerning 
 Sudanese science and learning contained in the native documents, 
 for we now see the scholars of Sankore confronted by the highest 
 developments of Arabian civilisation. How will they stand the 
 ordeal ? The test proves entirely to their advantage. 
 
 Among the exiles was a learned doctor, Ahmed Baba by name, 
 born in 1556 at Arawan, of Senhadjan 1 Berber parentage. In 
 spite of his youth, he enjoyed a considerable reputation in Tim- 
 buctoo at the time of the Moorish conquest, and his brethren 
 gave him the title of ' The Unique Pearl of his Time." His renown 
 increased in Morocco and became universal, spreading from Marra- 
 kesh to Bougie, Tunis, and even to Tripoli. The Arabs of the 
 north called this negro < very learned and very magnanimous,' and 
 his gaolers found him ' a fount of erudition. 1 At the request of 
 
 1 This tribe of Senhadja spread very freely over the south-west of Africa, and it is 
 from them that Senegal takes its name. 
 
POLITICS AND LITERATURE 307 
 
 the Moorish scholars the doors of his prison were opened a year 
 after his arrival (1596). All the believers were greatly pleased 
 with his release, and he was conducted in triumph from his prison 
 to the principal mosque of Marrakesh. A great many of the 
 learned men urged him to open a course of instruction. His 
 first thought was to refuse, but overcome by their persistence he 
 accepted a post in the Mosque of the Kerifs and taught rhetoric, 
 law, and theology. An extraordinary number of pupils attended 
 his lectures, and questions of the gravest importance were sub- 
 mitted to him by the magistracy, his decision always being treated 
 as final. With a modesty worthy of his learning, he said concern- 
 ing these decisions : ' I carefully examined from every point of 
 view the questions asked me, and having little confidence in my 
 own judgment I entreated the assistance of God, and the Lord 
 graciously enlightened me. 1 
 
 The ancient histories of Morocco relate many other interesting 
 details, and the author of the Bedzl el Mouasaha reports the follow- 
 ing utterance of Ahmed Baba : 6 Of all my friends I had the fewest 
 books, and yet when your soldiers despoiled me they took 1600 
 volumes. ' The Nozhel el Hadj gives the following instance of the 
 courage and pride of the negro sheik : ' After he was set at 
 liberty Ahmed Baba presented himself at the palace of El Man- 
 sour, and the sultan gave audience to him from behind a curtain. 
 " God has declared in the Koran," said the sheik, " that no human 
 being can communicate with Him hidden behind a veil. If it is 
 your wish to speak to me, come forth from behind that curtain.'* 
 When El Mansour raised the curtain and approached him, Ahmed 
 Baba continued, " What need had you to sack my house, steal my 
 books, and put me into chains to bring me to Morocco? By 
 means of those chains I fell from my camel and broke my leg." 
 " We wished to establish unity in the Mussulman world," replied 
 
308 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 the sultan, " and since you were one of the most distinguished 
 representatives of Islam in your country, we expected your sub- 
 mission to be followed by that of your fellow-citizens." " If that 
 is so, why did you not seek to establish this unity amongst the 
 Turks of Tlemcen and other places nearer to you ? " " Because 
 the Prophet says, Leave the Turks in peace so long as they do not 
 interfere with thee." " That was true at one time," responded 
 Ahmed Baba, "but since then Iba Abbas has said, Leave not 
 the Turks in peace even though they should not interfere with 
 thee." El Mansour, being unable to reply to this, put an end 
 to the audience/ 
 
 Although apparently free, Ahmed Baba was detained in 
 Morocco for twelve years; the sultan had only released him on 
 that condition, fearing the effect of his influence on his fellow- 
 citizens. It was not until after the death of El Mansour that 
 permission was obtained from his son for the learned man to return 
 to the Sudan. Ahmed Baba then set out for the country to 
 which he had so ardently desired to return, and of which he 
 never spoke without tears in his eyes. The following verses were 
 written by him in his exile : 
 
 4 O thou who goest to Gao,turn aside from thy path to breathe 
 my name in Timbuctoo. Bear thither the greeting of an exile 
 who sighs for the soil on which his friends and family reside. 
 Console my near and dear ones for the deaths of their lords, who 
 have been entombed." 
 
 The principal marabuts of Marrakesh formed him a guard of 
 honour at his departure, and, at the moment of farewell, one of 
 them seized Ahmed Baba by the hand and saluted him with the 
 following sura from the holy book : ' Certainly he who has made 
 the Koran for thee shall lead thee back to thy point of departure ' 
 a customary address to a traveller in wishing him a safe return. 
 
POLITICS AND LITERATURE 309 
 
 On hearing these words, the sheik abruptly withdrew his hand, 
 exclaiming, ' May God never bring me back to this meeting, nor 
 make me return to this country ! ' 
 
 He reach Timbuctoo in safety, and died in 16&7. 1 A man 
 of great learning and a prolific writer, the names of twenty of his 
 books have been handed down to us. Except for an astronomical 
 treatise, written in verse, and some commentaries on the holy texts, 
 his books are chiefly elucidations of the law and the sciences he pro- 
 fessed, and prove that he was above everything a jurist. Two of 
 his works alone possess general interest ; they have been preserved, 
 happily, and I was enabled to bring copies of them away with me. 
 One is entitled the Miraz. and is a little book upon the different 
 negraic peoples, written by Ahmed Baba in exile, with a view to 
 making the Sudanese populations known to the Moors. The 
 other is El Ibtihadj, a large biographical dictionary of the Mussul- 
 man doctors of the Malekite sect ; in it Ahmed Baba carried on 
 the famous work of Ibn Ferhoun, and made it a continuation of 
 the latter's D'ibadje. The learned biographer added to it the lives 
 of all the scholars whom Ibn Ferhoun had not mentioned. Ahmed 
 Baba completed his book in 1596, and it had such a great success 
 in both northern and negraic Africa that the author was obliged 
 to publish a popular edition containing the principal biographies 
 only. 2 
 
 It is partly owing to the Ibtihadj that it has been possible to 
 reconstruct the intellectual past of Timbuctoo, and for this reason 
 the name of Ahmed Baba deserves to be held in pious memory by 
 our savants, as it is by those of the Arabian countries of Northern 
 
 1 He was buried beside his father, Sidi Ahmed, whose tomb is still to be seen to 
 the north of Timbuctoo. 
 
 2 A copy of this book is to be found among the manuscripts of the Bibliotheque 
 Nationale, Fonds Orscela, No. 4628. It was found in Algeria by M. Cherbonneau, 
 who has published some very interesting extracts. 
 
310 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 Africa. To this day his name represents to the latter every effort 
 made by the Sudan to attain the intellectual level of the Mussul- 
 man world; so much so, in fact, that any Sudanese work of 
 unknown parentage is attributed to him. 
 
 The family of Ahmed Baba is not yet extinct, and I found 
 some of his descendants living near the mosque of Sankore in a 
 house of considerable size, which had been, I was told, the home of 
 their ancestor. One of his great-great-grandchildren, Ahmadou 
 Baba Boubakar, is kadi, and enjoys a considerable reputation for 
 learning; the other, Oumaro Baba, lives by making copies of 
 books, which he executes in a very beautiful handwriting. The 
 family religiously preserve a chair which had belonged to their 
 glorious progenitor, to whom it had been presented by his 
 liberator, the Sultan El Zidan. A curious family tradition is con- 
 nected with this venerated piece of furniture. On the occasion 
 of the marriage of a member of the family, the bridegroom is 
 permitted to seat himself in this chair on the day of his nuptials. 
 It is hoped, they told me, that some of the great qualities of 
 the illustrious sheik will fall upon the husband and his de- 
 scendants. 
 
 That sixteenth century, which we saw end so disastrously for 
 the marabuts, formed the apogee of Timbuctoo's scientific and 
 literary grandeur. The wholesale arrest and exportation of her 
 scholars proved a fatal blow to the university of Sankore. The 
 decline of learning, as of everything else, set in with the Moorish 
 occupation, and yet the greatest work of all the literature of the 
 Sudan was produced in the first days of its twilight, namely, 
 that Tarik e Soudan (the History of the Sudan) which we have 
 so often had occasion to mention. 
 
 The Orientalists have long been on the watch for this precious 
 book, whose existence had been signalled to them from Tripoli, 
 

312 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 Algeria, and Morocco, and which .had been unanimously attributed 
 to Ahmed Baba. 
 
 The explorer Barth, who was the first to reveal some of its 
 fragments, confirmed tnis error. How could a man so well in- 
 formed on Arabian subjects be so completely deceived ? The very 
 extracts collected by him refute this paternity, for they cite Ahmed 
 Baba as an authority. But the learned German is not to be 
 embarrassed by such a trifle. ' It is the custom of these Arabs, 1 
 he observes, ' to quote themselves. 1 
 
 If he had read the entire book with more attention, he would 
 have seen that the date year, month, and day of Ahmed Baba's 
 death is mentioned by the author, and that elsewhere he gives a 
 very circumstantial account of himself and his belongings. His 
 name is Abderrahman (ben Abdallah, ben Amran, ben Amar) Sadi 
 el Timbucti, and he was born at Timbuctoo (the ' object of 
 his affections "), of one of those families in which science and piety 
 are transmitted as a patrimony. In mentioning the death of an 
 illustrious professor, he observes that he, Abderrahman, was his 
 pupil ; and from this we may. gather that his youth was spent in 
 study. He arrived at the age of manhood somewhere between 
 1625 and 1635, at a time when the power of the pashas of 
 Timbuctoo was on the wane. The Moors had intermarried with 
 the native populations, and, instead of persecuting the sheiks as 
 formerly, they protected them, and made use of them when they 
 were in need of intelligent and devoted men. We can see with 
 what consideration a learned man like Abderrahman Sadi was 
 treated ; and the account of his journey to Massina and the regions 
 of the Upper Niger shows the high reputation he enjoyed, not only 
 in Timbuctoo, but in all the countries which shared the intellectual 
 life of that city. Wherever he went he was received with joy, 
 covered with marks of respect, and overwhelmed with presents.

 POLITICS AND LITERATURE 313 
 
 In 1631 he was nominated iman of the mosque of Jenne. 
 Deprived later of the honour by the kadi of the town, ' a man 
 who rejoiced in exactions and injustice,** he returned to Timbuctoo, 
 where society consoled him for his mortification by the most heart- 
 felt marks of sympathy. He relates that when he visited the 
 kadi of this city, ' he arose from his seat as soon as he saw me, 
 and, taking me by the hand, he seated me upon the chair he had 
 just vacated. 1 
 
 Abderrahman Sadi lived sometimes at Timbuctoo and some- 
 times at Jenne, being employed on negotiations and missions by 
 the pashas, and engaged as secretary to one of their number. He 
 also occupied his time in giving lectures and holding conferences, 
 and, above all, he undertook the great historical work which 
 embraced all the countries of the Niger. Thanks to his voyages, 
 his official functions, and his personal position, he had access to 
 all existing documents, so many of which have disappeared in the 
 toil and tumults of centuries. This work, to which he consecrated 
 the last years of his life, is inestimably precious. 
 
 The Tarik e Soudan is conceived upon a perfectly clear and 
 logical plan, according to the most correct rules of literary composi- 
 tion. Nothing is lacking, not even a preface, which I will quote 
 because it shows, among other things, the very clear, perhaps exag- 
 gerated, estimate the author had of the decadence of the empire : 
 
 ' Praise be to God whom the weight of a pearl upon the earth 
 does not escape. May prayer and salvation be with the Master 
 of the first and last, our Lord Mohammed. We know that our 
 ancestors took pleasure in mentioning the companions of the 
 Prophet and the saints, the sheiks and eminent kings of their 
 country, with their lives, their edifices, and the great events of their 
 reigns. They have told us all that they have seen, or heard, of 
 the times extending behind us. 
 
314 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 4 As for the present time, no one is to be found to take an 
 interest in these things or follow the path traced by their 
 ancestors. Witnessing the decline of this science (history), so 
 precious on account of the instruction it offers to mankind, I have 
 implored the assistance of God in writing down all that I have 
 read, seen, or heard concerning the kings of the Sudan and the 
 Songhoi people, and in relating their history and the events con- 
 nected with their expeditions of war. I shall speak of Timbuctoo 
 and of its foundation, of the princes who have wielded the power 
 of that city, I shall mention the learned and pious men who dwelt 
 therein, and I shall continue this history to the close of the 
 dominion of the sultans of Morocco. 1 * 
 
 After this prelude he opens his history at the earliest date 
 known to him, and notices the origin of the Songhoi kingdom, 
 the founding of Jenne and Timbuctoo, and of the empires of 
 Ganata and Mali. He rapidly and clearly familiarises the reader 
 with the principal towns and peoples which are to figure in his 
 narrative, and he enters fully into his subject with Sunni AH. 
 We are taken as far as the year 1653, and given an excellent 
 idea of Foulbes, Touaregs, Mossi, and Ouolofs by the way. He 
 dilates upon Morocco and the kingdom of Massina, adds a series 
 of biographies of saints and scholars, and appends his own curri- 
 culum vitce. 
 
 He does not consider his work ended with the task he set 
 himself to do, however, and the historian takes up the pen of 
 the annalist. ' What shall happen hereafter I will relate in the 
 same manner as that which is past, for as long as I shall be 
 alive,' says the last page of the Tarik. An appendix enumerates 
 all the events until 1656, which we may take to have been the 
 year of his death. 
 
 Such is the plan of the important work which served as my 
 
POLITICS AND LITERATURE 315 
 
 charming and picturesque guide through the Sudan. It forms, 
 with the exception of the holy writings, the favourite volume 
 of the negro, and is known to the furthest extremity of western 
 Africa, from the shores of the Niger to the borders of Lake 
 Chad. Barth discovered fragments of it at Gando, and I heard 
 it spoken of in Senegal. I found an excellent copy in Jenne, 
 and had a duplicate made from it, which was corrected from 
 an example at Timbuctoo, so that we possess the book in as 
 complete a form as possible. 1 
 
 Its style is very simple and clear, entirely lacking those 
 literary artifices so much in vogue among the Arabs ; and the 
 author displays an unusual conscientiousness, never hesitating 
 to give both versions of a doubtful event. His biography of 
 the great infidel, Sunni Ali, shows him to be sufficiently im- 
 partial, and his book is above everything remarkable for the 
 admirable philosophy (Islamic, be it understood) pervading it. 
 It is a work of elevated morals, and is particularly adapted to 
 exercise a happy influence upon the negraic mind ; for Abder- 
 rahman is not content with a mere narration of events he 
 explains them, and that without having recourse to the con- 
 venient fatalism of the Mussulman who says of a calamitous 
 event, 'It was written. 1 He accounts for incidents as being 
 the reward of God when they are fortunate, and as the punish- 
 ment of such and such a crime when they are disastrous. 
 Severe towards all infractions of the divine law by kings and 
 humble alike, and sternly stigmatising all cruelty, he relates 
 every good action with obvious pleasure, and exalts all forms 
 of courage, especially the civic. The whole book is a collection 
 of active morals, and is one of the most charming of its kind,

 preparing a complete translation. 
 
316 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 for fables, marvels, and miracles are agreeably intermingled 
 with real events. 
 
 I will remark further that the Tarik is to this day the 
 Hozier of the Sudan. In addition to the attractions to be 
 found in its pages, it contains a charm which entirely escapes 
 the Sudanese, and which we alone are privileged to taste, viz. 
 the naivete, good-nature, and delicious sincerity which pervade 
 the book. Like Homer, Abderrahman sometimes wanders astray, 
 pen in hand. Side by side with the gravest events he mentions 
 that ' a white crow appeared from the 22nd of Rebia to the 
 28th of Djoumada, on which day the children caught and killed 
 it/ Elsewhere in the narratives of his voyage to Massina, one 
 of his hosts gave him his daughter in marriage. He was fifty 
 years of age at the time, and in possession of several other 
 wives. Not content with imparting the event to posterity, he 
 adds, ' My union with Fatima was concluded on the twelfth day 
 of Moharrem, 1645, but the marriage was not consummated 
 until Friday the sixteenth. 1 I believe he would have given us 
 his washing-bills if the use of body linen had been familiar 
 to the Sudanese. His book admirably reflects the life and mind 
 of the Sudan of yesterday. One enjoys from its pages the 
 delicate repasts offered by Homer, Herodotus, and Froissard, 
 and it is for this reason I have called the Tarik the chef-cCceuvre 
 of Sudanese literature. 
 
 I found and brought away from Timbuctoo other historical 
 works composed at later date, upon the model of the Tarik. 
 One of them is called the Diwan el Moulouk, fi Salatin es 
 Sudan (Divan of Kings, a book on the Sultans of the Sudan), 
 and narrates the events occurring between 1656 and 1747; the 
 name of the author is unknown. Another book, on the con- 
 trary, has no title, but is known to us by the name of its 
 
POLITICS AND LITERATURE 
 
 317 
 
 author, Mouley Rhassoun. He resumes the Diwan from the 
 last date given in its pages and carries it up to the year 1769, 
 so that we are well instructed up to the beginning of the nine- 
 teenth century. Other documents 
 and oral traditions permit us to 
 reconstruct the order of dates 
 
 A SUDANESE SCENIC : 
 A READING IN THE STREET 
 
 and events, and, in its broad outlines at least, the whole of the 
 Sudanese past is known to us. 
 
 Although these two books are precious for their historical 
 value, they entirely lack the literary merits which charm us in 
 
318 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 the Tarik. Intellectual decadence has made rapid strides since 
 the eighteenth century, and the author of the Diwan states in 
 his first pages : 
 
 ' The men of my generation have arrived at the point where 
 their intellects possess nothing. As for the old men, those who 
 know the deeds of their ancestors are few and far between, and 
 those possessing any intelligence at all are equally rare. When 
 I question them concerning what is passing in the town, they 
 are incapable of making a response of any interest.' 
 
 His narrative reveals the fact that he himself was betrayed 
 into the errors he deplores. His style is full of faults, the pages 
 are encumbered with repetitions, and the interest of the narrative 
 gradually declines. The work of Mouley Rhassoun is still more 
 feeble, consisting entirely of dry records and obituary notices. 
 
 4 Why did they not write more books and abandon records ? ' 
 was the question I asked the marabuts at Timbuctoo. ' We 
 have no men among us clever enough to do so,' they answered. 
 'Nor can we devote ourselves exclusively to science; we cannot 
 buy books nor travel to complete our learning in Cairo, Fez, 
 or elsewhere, for to-day we are the poorest people in the country. 
 Formerly the people noted the most uninteresting things; they 
 counted the number of days on which rain fell in winter ; they 
 mentioned that such-and-such a person was going to marry so- 
 and-so. For Ahmed Baba had taught the importance of the 
 science of facts and dates. 1 When the town was rich and every 
 one sought to please the marabuts, they were well clothed and 
 
 1 The following encounter took place between the chief of chiefs Omar and a 
 Jew who brought him a document in which the Prophet commanded the exemption 
 from taxation of the people of Khaibar (a Jewish town in Arabia). This document 
 was accompanied by the testimony of the companions of the Prophet, Ali Ibn Abm 
 Thaleb among others. These documents were brought to the chief of chiefs, and 
 caused great astonishment to all people. They were shown to Aben Bekr, a prudent 
 man and endowed with a wonderful memory. He reflected a moment, then said, ' All 
 
POLITICS AND LITERATURE 319 
 
 fed, they could give themselves to meditation and read books 
 and write them. But for the last hundred years there have been 
 nothing but wars and ruin. We have only known peace since 
 the arrival of the French. We marabuts have to run about 
 right and left to procure a livelihood, the education of children 
 brings us in so little. Sometimes we are asked to write talis- 
 mans and to copy books, but that does not give us sufficient to 
 live upon. Many are obliged to devote themselves to commerce ; 
 and, absorbed by the care of not dying of hunger, how can they 
 find time to write ? ' 
 
 I have shown the town of yesterday, Timbuctoo the great, 
 under all its aspects. 
 
 Let us now allow our imaginations to be carried back to the 
 days of its splendour. Let us picture the caravans of Morocco, 
 Tuat, and Tripoli travelling for weeks and months across that 
 immensity of sands ' where the very birds lose themselves.' The 
 sun blazes fiercely in the flaming sky, the skin cracks, and the 
 lips are parched. All the water to be had is warm and impure, 
 and even then cannot be procured in sufficient quantities. A 
 scaly viper occasionally crosses the route, and at long intervals 
 the swift flight of an antelope is seen. 
 
 For days and months nothing rejoices the eye save the 
 deceitful vision of the mirage, until Taoudenni, the great halting- 
 place, the city of salt, has been reached. 
 
 One morning three little black spots show upon the burning 
 
 this is a lie.' * How so?' they asked him. ' I find the evidence of Mo'awai in this 
 document,' he replied, 'and Mo'awai did not embrace Islamism until the year of the 
 capture of Khaibar. I also see the testimony of Sa'ad ben Mo'adh, and he died on 
 the day of Bani-Karaide before the capture of Khaibar.' This incident greatly amused 
 the people. 
 
 The above anecdote is related by Ahmed Baba in the beginning of his Ibti- 
 hadj.

 horizon. The camels cease to grumble, they roar; and, as the 
 three minarets grow clearer, Timbuctoo displays her majestic 
 form. Behold her gardens, her palm-trees, and her gleaming 
 waters ! The town is three times as large as it is to-day, the 
 streets are fresh and blue under the shade of the great trees, and 
 they seethe with the life of its fifty thousand inhabitants. 
 
 In place of the solitude, abandonment, and misery of to-day, 
 it presents the traveller with a satiety of everything desirable. 
 With abundance of water and shade, it represents the saving 
 help of the word of God, the charm of the word of man, the 
 wealth of gold and ivory, the sweetness of honey and a profusion 
 of smiles. ... I have been told that men went temporarily mad 
 upon seeing it for the first time. 
 
 Can we not understand how it was that the men of Tripoli,' 
 Tunis, Algeria, and Fez, having experienced its pleasures for one 
 day only, have celebrated the splendours of Timbuctoo to their 
 last hour, and how it was that their narratives, reaching Europe, 
 gave birth to the legend of the fabulous city ? 
 
CHAPTER XV 
 
 EUROPE AND TIMBUCTOO 
 
 ALL who have studied the remarkable genius of Colbert proclaim 
 his ideas to have been greatly in advance of his century. It 
 will not surprise us, therefore, to find his name among the first of 
 those who attempted to open the gates of Timbuctoo to Europe. 
 
 The great minister acquired a very clear apprehension of the 
 value of the Sudan from a report made by Andre Bruc, governor 
 of the African colonies, and he conceived the notion of reaching 
 Timbuctoo by way of Senegal. This plan, which received the 
 approbation of Louis xiv., was precisely that followed by Faid- 
 herbe forty years ago, continued by Borgnis-Desbordes and 
 Archinard, and finally completed in the last days of 1894. 
 
 We shall see later on how Lieutenant Boiteux took posses- 
 sion of Timbuctoo in the name of France, and how the tricolour 
 was hoisted in the town for the first time by one of his sailors. 
 Now, if ever, we might say, ' It was written, 1 for the first European 
 to see Timbuctoo was also a Frenchman and a sailor, Paul Imbert, 
 who was born on the sands of Olonne. I must add that his 
 journey thither was purely involuntary. He was shipwrecked on 
 the coast of Morocco, captured by the Arabs, and sold as a slave to 
 a Portuguese renegade in the service of the sultan. His master, 
 sent on a mission by the Moorish government, took the old sailor 
 with him to Timbuctoo in 1670. Paul Imbert contrived to send 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 news of his misfortunes to Europe, but died in captivity before it 
 was possible to effect his release. 
 
 The third name connected with Timbuctoo is that of Mungo 
 Park. Starting from Gambia, he succeeded in reaching the Niger 
 at Segu, and was the first European to see the great river of 
 Western Africa (1795). He published a most attractive account 
 of the Niger, which is doubled in value by the solid information 
 of the writer. His book was the point of departure for numerous 
 explorations into this portion of Africa in the early part of the 
 present century, and is still well worth reading. The Sudan is 
 shown at a relatively normal period, and the picture is drawn by 
 an interesting and competent pen. 
 
 The giant river exercised the same fascination upon Mungo 
 Park which was experienced by myself, and which I have attempted 
 to describe, and he soon returned to it with the intention of 
 descending the river to its mouth (1805). He was accompanied 
 by forty Europeans thirty-five English soldiers, four carpenters, 
 and an artist named Scott. This little troop, considerably lessened 
 in number by fever, reached the Niger at Bammaku. I found 
 very vivid recollections of Mungo Park below this town. He 
 had been well provided with merchandise, and had displayed a 
 generosity in dealing with the people which had deeply impressed 
 itself on their memories. They naturally do not speak of him by 
 his real name, which could have no meaning for them, and would 
 have been difficult to remember ; but like all the early Europeans 
 who ventured into those parts, he was given a picturesque 
 sobriquet, and called Bonciba-tigui, ' the man with the large 
 beard ' (literally : batigui, owner ; bonci, beard ; ba, large). 
 
 The natives also spoke of him at Samba-Marcalla, a charming- 
 little town built under large and beautiful trees, upon the left 
 bank of the Niger, between Nyamina and Segu. The traveller 
 
EUROPE AND TIMBUCTOO 323 
 
 spent several days here, tempted doubtless by his warm reception 
 and the blue shade in which the quiet life of its inhabitants was 
 passed. In acknowledgment of their hospitality Park presented 
 the mosque with a Chinese vase, with which to adorn the summit 
 of its minaret, and this ornament was still to be seen in 1888. 
 One day, the gunboats having dropped anchor before Samba-Mar- 
 calla, their commanders, MM. Hourst and Davout, induced the 
 inhabitants to exchange the vase for another, and the traveller's 
 gift was brought to France and placed in the Colonial Office. 
 Learning further that one of the companions of ' the man with 
 the great beard ' had died at Samba-Marcalla, our officers had the 
 grave of the Englishman pointed out to them, and their gunners 
 forged a fine iron cross, which marks the resting-place of the 
 unknown to this day. It bears the following inscription : 
 
 TO THE MEMORY 
 OF ONE OF THE COMPANIONS OF 
 
 MUNGO PARK 
 
 WHO WAS BURIED HERE 
 
 The Niger Fleet. November 1888. 
 
 According to a tradition transmitted to the inhabitants of 
 Samba-Marcalla, Mtingo Parkas companions were at this time 
 reduced to seven. 
 
 Permission to enter Segu being refused him, the explorer went 
 on to Sansanding. He met with a better reception there, and 
 was the guest of Kounta-Mamadi, the richest merchant of the 
 town, and grandfather of the present chief, who told me that 
 Park had been greatly liked by the inhabitants. He had sold 
 them merchandise and made little presents to the children ; a saw 
 which had been given by him to his host has been carefully 
 preserved by the family. 
 
 Having journeyed hitherto by land, Mungo Park embarked 
 
TIMBUCTOO * 
 
 upon the Niger at Sansanding in a large, flat-bottomed boat he 
 had had constructed ; and from there, ignorant of which of the 
 many possible routes he had taken to reach Timbuctoo, I found it 
 difficult to trace him. He was spoken of at Kabara, but he had 
 
 CROSS RAISED TO ONE OF THE COMPANIONS OF MUNGO PARK 
 
 not been able to reach that port on account of the hostilities of 
 the Touaregs, who attacked him at Koriouma. 
 
 Mungo Park was therefore obliged to turn his back upon 
 Timbuctoo, and Barth found traces of him at Bamba, Bourroum, 
 and Gao. The appearance of the white man with the great beard 
 and his large boat has become a legend on the shores of the 
 Eastern Niger, and the end of the courageous explorer is well 
 known. His boat was smashed upon the rocks of the Boussa 
 rapids, at a comparatively short distance from the mouth of the 
 
EUROPE AND TIMBUCTOO 325 
 
 Niger, and the brave Scotsman and his four or five remaining 
 companions were drowned. 
 
 The soldiers and considerable sums of money placed at Mungo 
 Park's disposal prove how much the Nigerian countries interested 
 England at this time. She made repeated efforts to penetrate 
 Western Africa between 1810 and 1825, the most remarkable 
 being conducted by Major Laing, aide-de-camp to the governor 
 of Sierra Leone. This young officer also succeeded in making his 
 way to the Niger, reaching it at Falaba. He, too, was a Scots- 
 man, as powerfully constituted and well-informed as his com- 
 patriot, and was looked upon by England as a second Mungo 
 Park. His government provided him with large resources, and 
 the mission of attaining Timbuctoo was confided to him in 
 1825. 
 
 His first voyage having familiarised him with the negraic 
 countries, Laing preferred to take the northern route in his 
 second, and traverse the Arabian and Berber countries. Starting 
 from Tripoli, he passed through Ghadames, Tuat, Oualata, and 
 Arawan, was attacked in the desert by the Touaregs, and reached 
 Timbuctoo in August 1828. 
 
 I have collected fresh details concerning his stay there and his 
 death. Although they are somewhat at variance with the 
 generally accepted account, I do not hesitate to vouch for them, 
 as they came from an excellent source. They were communicated 
 to me by the most learned man in Timbuctoo, the alamany, or 
 religious chief of the town, and grand iman of the great mosque of 
 Ghingaraber. He was an old man, bent with age and almost 
 blind, but of still reliable intelligence and well versed in the 
 traditions of the town. He had obtained his facts from his uncle, 
 Alpha Saidou, who was grand kadi and judge of Timbuctoo at the 
 
326 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 time of the Scotsman's stay there, and was therefore in a position 
 to be well informed. 
 
 Laing, who was known under the name of El Rais, the chief 
 (given him, doubtless, on account of his rank as major), presented 
 himself as an envoy from the English government to the chief of 
 the town, Osman-Alcaidi ben Alcaidi Boubakar. According to 
 custom, the latter offered him one of his houses as a dwelling, 
 which, thanks to the alamany, whose uncle Saidou had also lived 
 in it, I was enabled to see. The family being extinct in the direct 
 line, the house became, according to custom, the property of the 
 chief of the town. 
 
 It is situated in a little square near the great market and the 
 mosque of Ghingaraber, and is surrounded by the usual shabby, 
 dilapidated houses and straw huts with straw enclosures. On 
 one side of the square an oblong mound of masonry represents the 
 
 LAING'S HOUSE 
 
 tomb of some saint, or Oualiou. The house appears to have 
 been one story high, and of good size, but I found it in the 
 process of demolition. 1 The facade was destroyed, and the first 
 
 1 I procured from its destroyers a little wooden Moorish window belonging to the 
 upper story, in which the traveller lived during his stay. I brought away the poor 
 relic, which is in every way worthy of a place in the Greenwich Hospital by the side 
 of the mementoes of the Franklin Polar expedition. 
 
EUROPE AND TIMBUCTOO 327 
 
 floor, by falling in, had warned its inhabitants that it was time 
 to begin repairs. The masons were clearing away the ruins, 
 leaving the thick walls of the ground floor standing ready for 
 rebuilding, and the square was encumbered with bricks drying 
 in the sun. 
 
 The Touaregs having extorted a ransom, but not pillaged him, 
 Laing arrived with considerable baggage, and was able to make 
 the usual presents to the chief of the town. He explained that 
 he had been sent by his government to see the commerce and 
 life of the city, that the white people wished to make acquaint- 
 ance with the inhabitants of countries unknown to them, and 
 establish friendly relations which could only result in good to both 
 sides. Such a task had often been confided to him before. The 
 second day after his arrival he was to be seen exploring the 
 town, taking notes, drawing great lines (plans?) upon paper, 
 and questioning the passers-by. 
 
 The chief of the town entered into relations with him, and 
 visited him pretty frequently ; but the other inhabitants, great and 
 small, maintained a marked reserve. His questions had excited 
 great suspicion ; and he seems to have committed the error of not 
 taking all and sundry into his confidence, and elaborately explain- 
 ing his presence and business to them. ' He did not know how to 
 gain the confidence of the people,' the old alamany told me. ' He 
 did not talk to them and amuse them. If he had done so, he 
 would have had friends in the town, and they would have warned 
 him of what was being plotted against him. Now, every one is 
 aware that you are neither soldier nor merchant, and we all know 
 that you want to see everything and hear everything and read our 
 books, not to do us harm, but to tell the white people the history 
 of the blacks. Every one comes to you, your house is far from 
 the fort, and you live alone with your servant. Well, if any 
 
328 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 one conspired against you, certainly I, or one of those who know 
 you, would warn you." 
 
 The people were afraid of Laing and his notes and questions, 
 and the surname of El Rais doubtless added to their fears. The 
 unhappy man did nothing to offend or shock the inhabitants, 
 and no one had any reproach to bring against him, but all 
 unanimously agreed that the suspicion of his being a spy had 
 finally roused the hostility of the people. This was evidently 
 the real cause of his death, and not, as was supposed, the fact 
 of his being a Christian. 
 
 Some days before his departure Laing determined to visit 
 Kabara, and persisted in riding there after nightfall, in spite of 
 the warnings of his host as to the insecurity of the road. This 
 last imprudence seems to have been decisive. ' He is undoubtedly 
 a spy,' thought the inhabitants, and, urged by the populace, the 
 notables of the town planned the murder of the stranger. His 
 host, the chief of the town, was charged with his arrest. Being 
 asked by Laing (who had decided to return by Arawan) to pro- 
 cure him a guide, Osman-Alcaidi sent for the chief of the Bera- 
 bichs, a Moorish tribe encamped in the neighbourhood. To this 
 man, Sidi Mohammed Habeida (grandfather of the present chief), 
 the Alcaidi confided the anxieties of the town, and requested 
 him to dispose of the European, body and goods. 
 
 The witnesses are unanimously agreed upon this point, the 
 Berabichs did not kill Laing upon their own initiative, nor 
 because he was a Christian, but at the formal request of the 
 chief of Timbuctoo. This new version is evidently the true 
 one ; for if in certain cases interest may compel them to disguise 
 the truth, it would clearly have been to the interest of the natives, 
 in this instance, to put all the responsibility of the murder upon 
 the shoulders of the Berabichs, and not charge themselves with it. 
 
EUROPE AND TIMBUCTOO 329 
 
 Mohammed Habeida made no difficulty about accepting a 
 part which did no violence to the pillaging instincts of his 
 tribe, and Laing left Timbuctoo under his guidance. For two 
 days they travelled together towards Arawan, and the unfor- 
 tunate man was killed at dawn on the third day. 
 
 Laing's visit and the circumstances accompanying it are still 
 vividly impressed upon the memories of the inhabitants ; for, at 
 the instance of England I believe, the Sultan of Morocco made 
 an inquiry at Timbuctoo concerning his death. At that time 
 the authorities naturally did not care to assume the responsi- 
 bility of the deed, and would certainly shift it on to the backs 
 of the Berabichs. In this way the version which made Laing 
 a victim of the fanaticism of the desert was accepted. 
 
 One of his last letters announced that he had collected 
 numerous manuscripts on the subject of Timbuctoo, and these 
 precious documents naturally occupied the mind of the scientists 
 and explorers a good deal. Rene Caillie made inquiries con- 
 cerning them, and reported that they had been dispersed among 
 the inhabitants of the desert. Barth raised the question twenty- 
 five years later, and was told that not one remained. Lenz, on the 
 contrary, believes that the papers and effects are still preserved 
 in Arawan. Since our installation in Timbuctoo, the military 
 authorities have made several attempts to discover the fate of 
 these letters from envoys sent by the chief of the Berabichs. 
 M. Josse, the Arabian interpreter, was especially persevering, 
 but in vain ; the Berabichs insisted that nothing remained in 
 their possession. For my part, I made the acquaintance, during 
 my stay, of an agent of the Mossi, with whom I was at pains 
 to be on excellent terms, and who rendered me many little 
 services. One evening I sent for him, and, with air of great 
 mystery, offered him a large sum of money if he would find 
 
330 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 the papers of El Rais and bring them to me. I assured him 
 that no one in the town, European or native, should know any- 
 thing about it ; but in spite of all my diplomacy, I was no more 
 successful than the rest. Some time afterwards he assured me 
 that the tribe possessed neither papers nor anything else belong- 
 ing to the traveller. Knowing the keen distrust of these people, 
 however, and the fear of punishment they still entertain (in spite 
 of repeated assurances), and, knowing too, the great respect with 
 which all written matter is regarded in these countries, I do not 
 think all hope need be abandoned. 
 
 If the first explorer to reach Timbuctoo was an Englishman, 
 the first to come back from it was a Frenchman Rene Caillie, to 
 wit. As was proved by the Grand Prix of 10,000 francs offered 
 by the Geographical Society of Paris to the first visitor from 
 Timbuctoo, the interest to Europe consisted in the return. 
 
 Behold the perversity of things, or, if you will, the ways of 
 Providence. Mungo Park and Laing departed accompanied by 
 the good wishes and encouragement of their countrymen, well 
 provided with money, merchandise, and escort and failed. 
 Success was reserved for a humble and solitary man of ridiculously 
 small means who had been contemptuously repulsed by the repre- 
 sentatives of his country, and who had scarcely a friend to press 
 his hand at parting. 
 
 'I was born," says Rene Caillie, 'in 1800 at Mauze, in the 
 department of the two Sevres, of poor parents, whom I had the 
 misfortune to lose in my childhood. 1 was apprenticed to a trade 
 as soon as I could read and write, but it was not long before I 
 wearied of it, thanks to the books of travel which I read in all my 
 leisure moments. I borrowed geographical works ; and the maps 
 of Africa, in which I saw deserts and unknown regions marked, 
 
EUROPE AND TIMBUCTOO 331 
 
 excited my keenest interest. Finally, the interest became a passion 
 to which I sacrificed everything." 
 
 He started for Senegal at the age of sixteen with a fortune of 
 sixty francs in his pocket. Of the two vessels starting on the same 
 day for the same port, he had the good luck to choose the one which 
 arrived safely ; the other, the Medusa, made a notable shipwreck. 
 
 He disembarked at St. Louis (1816), where nothing was being- 
 talked of but the English expeditions into the interior. He made 
 an attempt to join one of these, but a French officer dissuaded 
 him and sent him to Guadeloupe, where he obtained a small 
 employment which kept him at Point a Pitre for six months. The 
 narratives of Mungo Park having fallen into his hands, he returned 
 to Senegal at the end of that time, more absorbed in Africa 
 than ever. 
 
 This brings us to the year 1818, and the English have in no 
 wise relaxed their efforts to penetrate the interior. The expedition 
 of Major Grey was just succeeding to that of Majors Peddie and 
 Campbell, and Rene Caillie attached himself to it 'without 
 appointment or engagement of any kind, 1 happy in only being 
 allowed to start. The Europeans were all mounted, but he had 
 to make the journey on foot ; and if he did not share the comforts 
 of his companions, he certainly had his part of the dangers and 
 sickness, for on his return he was obliged to go back to France to 
 recruit his health. 
 
 These hardships proved no discouragement, however, and he 
 returned to Senegal in a small sloop in 1824. He entered into 
 trade upon his arrival, and his business prospered ; but this was 
 not what he had come for. It was not a fortune that he wanted ; 
 as he says himself, ' Timbuctoo had become the one object of my 
 thoughts, the aim of all my efforts, and I was determined to reach 
 it or die in the attempt/ 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 He neglected nothing to ensure the success of this great enter- 
 prise. Realising that a knowledge of Arabic and the forms of 
 the Mohammedan religion was essential, he submitted to a second 
 and severer trial. Leaving his business, and attiring himself in 
 Moorish dress, he went to the Braknas Moors with the request 
 that he might live with their tribe and be converted to Islamism. 
 He suffered many annoyances and much ill-treatment, but he 
 learned to talk, read, and write Arabic, and was initiated into the 
 mysteries of the Koran and the Mussulman prayers. He then 
 returned to St. Louis to find the means of putting into execution 
 his plan of reaching Timbuctoo and travelling across Africa to 
 Egypt, under the guise of a merchant and pilgrim to Mecca. 
 
 His real hardships were to begin now ; for, instead of being 
 encouraged in his purpose and congratulated upon the task he had 
 achieved, he was received with cold sarcasm at St. Louis. Instead 
 of the 6000 francs he asked for to buy the necessary merchandise, 
 the governor of Senegal allowed him soldier's rations that he 
 might not die of hunger, and found him employment with a 
 salary of fifty francs a month. 'The fatigue and privations I 
 endured had perhaps entitled me to expect something better, 1 is 
 his sole comment. 
 
 A new governor, Baron Roger, arriving in Senegal, Caillie's 
 hopes revived, and for the second time he related his sojourn 
 among the Moors and explained his plans. This is how he tells 
 the story of his attempt : 
 
 'M. Roger pooh-poohed my project, and refused me any 
 pecuniary aid. This would have been a thunderbolt to any one 
 else, but it only had the effect of more deeply rooting my deter- 
 mination. I had the courage to return to the charge, and he was 
 then good enough to promise me a certain sum upon my return 
 from Timbuctoo. . . . Upon my return from Timbuctoo ! And 
 
EUROPE AND T1MBUCTOO 333 
 
 if I died on the way ? This idea, terrible to a man who would 
 leave a much-loved sister without help or resources, determined 
 my reply. I refused every arrangement, deciding that if I 
 died, I Avould at least leave the friend of my childhood one 
 incontestable possession the merit of having done everything by 
 myself.' 
 
 While France refused him 6000 francs, England was spending 
 eighteen million francs in attempting to penetrate from the western 
 coast of Africa. Caillie now turned to the English colony of 
 Sierra Leone, and at once aroused the interest of the governor, 
 General Charles Turner. He obtained, instead of the ridiculous 
 employment offered to him by a Frenchman, the direction of an 
 indigo factory and a salary of 3600 francs. He would probably 
 have succeeded in getting the 6000 francs for his voyage, but the 
 governor objected very reasonably from an Englishman's point of 
 view that Major Laing was already en route for Timbuctoo, and 
 he could not have a hand in depriving him of the glory of being 
 there first. 
 
 Caillie succeeded in saving 2000 francs, however, and was no 
 longer affected by the refusal. Having resumed the Moorish 
 costume, he converted his savings into merchandise, and set out 
 upon his journey (1827). 
 
 His stock of goods being too small to permit of his giving 
 himself out to be a trader, as he had first intended, he invented a 
 new pretext. ' Born in Egypt,' he told every one, ' I was taken 
 as a child and made to serve in the French army, which was 
 then in Egypt. I was brought as a slave to France, and my 
 master took me with him to Senegal to assist him in his business. 
 He was so pleased with my services that he gave me my liberty, 
 and now that I am free to go where I will, I naturally desire to 
 return to Egypt to find my parents, and resume the Mussulman 
 
334 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 religion/ Thanks to his knowledge of Arabic and the prayers of 
 the Mussulman cult, the fable of his origin was everywhere 
 accepted, and his journey was made comparatively easy. He 
 entered Timbuctoo on the 20th of April 1828, having passed 
 by the Foota Jalion, reached the Niger at Kankan, traversed 
 the Bambara kingdom of Segu, and paused at Jenne by the 
 way. 
 
 As Caillie was taken for the man he pretended to be, I found 
 it exceedingly difficult to follow his track. All inquiries at Jenne 
 were fruitless, and I feared they would be equally so at Timbuctoo, 
 for poor Arabian travellers arrive there all the year round, and he 
 had only stayed fourteen days in the city. The name of his host, 
 however, Sidi Abdallah Chabir, one of the most important 
 merchants of his time, was perfectly well remembered. One of 
 his wives had. died only within the last few years, and his son 
 but shortly before my arrival. I saw the house in which Caillie 
 had lodged, and the old alamany revived some memories of the 
 explorer himself. 
 
 The latter had not failed to impart the history of his Egyptian 
 origin, his misfortunes, and his slavery in France, and I was thus 
 enabled to trace him. The old alamany repeated to me (with 
 some variations) the fable mentioned above as concerning a 
 traveller lodged by Sidi Abdallah. The worthy merchant, an 
 Arab fond of remarkable stories, had been greatly struck by this 
 tale, and, being a pious man into the bargain, he had been deeply 
 touched by the religious zeal of the young Egyptian. From all 
 this Sidi Abdallah had concocted a narrative which he delighted 
 to impart to his friends, and which he accompanied by improving 
 reflections on the tenacity of the Mussulman faith. The history 
 was so often repeated in Timbuctoo that the Grand Kadi, Alpha 
 
EUROPE AND TIMBITCTOO 
 
 335 
 
 Saidou, noted it down as one of the curious episodes of his time. 
 He edited his history under the direction of Sidi Abdallah, and 
 hlackened four sheets of paper with it. Although the old 
 alamany had inherited a portion of his uncle's books and papers, 
 this curious manuscript was not among them, he assured me. I 
 requested him to make inquiries of the other inheritors of the 
 kadi, and was then told that the papers had been burnt in a 
 recent fire. This explanation does not appear to merit any great 
 amount of belief, and one day somebody will doubtless be more 
 fortunate than myself. The history was probably embellished 
 with imprecations on the Christians, and they were therefore not 
 over anxious to communicate it to me. 
 
 The house pointed out to me as having been lived in by the 
 Egyptian was situated near the market, and in the same street as 
 the one Laing had occupied. His dwelling, more fortunate than 
 Laing's, is still standing in a very good state 
 of preservation in the interior, be it 
 understood. It is a large house, 
 
 CAILLIE'S HOUSE 
 
386 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 plainly indicating the importance of the man who showed the 
 poor traveller such gracious hospitality. Sidi Abdallah did not live 
 in it himself, but used it as a warehouse. It is now occupied by 
 one of the principal merchants of Timbuctoo, a Moor, like Sidi 
 Abdallah, and he too has converted it into a shop. I, therefore, 
 saw the dwelling under much the same aspect it must have 
 worn to Rene Caillie. 
 
 I found, surrounding the two spacious courts, ' the little, long, 
 narrow and windowless rooms, serving indifferently as shop or 
 bedroom,'' in one of which Rene Caillie lodged, and in which 
 4 he suffocated day and night. 1 The interior was encumbered with 
 packages and sacks of all kinds, principally bales of ostrich feathers 
 and ivory. Lances thrust into the floor showed that the men of 
 the Desert occupied those suffocating rooms at the moment. The. 
 real proprietor of the house, Mohammed El Bakir, had just 
 received his annual caravan from Tendouf, a Moorish town on 
 the borders of the Sahara. His relations had great troops of 
 camels over there, and they were enabled to continue their com- 
 merce in spite of the insecurity of the desert routes, for they 
 belonged to a family of marabuts possessing great influence in the 
 Sahara. I was on excellent terms with Mohammed El Bakir, 
 and he it was who furnished me with some notion of the present 
 state of the commerce of Timbuctoo. He was acquainted with 
 Europeans, having traded with them at Mogador, where it was his 
 custom to buy large quantities of our produce. I was surprised, 
 nevertheless, when he asked me for news of Paris (he pronounced 
 it Parisse). He said he had long known the name of the town, for 
 the rich Moorish Jew who bought his ostrich plumes lived there. 
 His curiosity had been excited by the marvels described to him by 
 a Moor who had visited the city during the exhibition, and he 
 wished to know if he had not been the dupe of a too lively 
 
EUROPE AND TIMBUCTOO 337 
 
 imagination. I reassured him, of course, and told him the true 
 history of Rene Caillie. To risk one^s life and sacrifice one's 
 interests for the simple satisfaction of seeing a new town or 
 country was incomprehensible to him, but he understood, never- 
 theless, that in our eyes his house was the most interesting thing 
 in Timbuctoo, and I profited by that to advise him to keep it in 
 very particular repair. 
 
 Whether it was the considerable sacrifices made by the English 
 Government for Laing, or whether it was owing to the great con- 
 fidence the public had in this brilliant officer, I do not know, 
 but the English have always expressed great contempt for Rene 
 Caillie's success. Their disdain developed into injustice, and 'they 
 disputed his journey, his book, and his sojourn in Timbuctoo, 
 professing themselves completely edified when, twenty-five years 
 later, the truth of Caillie's statements was confirmed by a 
 German. 
 
 The English Government made a fresh effort to reach the 
 Sudan in 1850. Richardson was equipped at Tripoli with the 
 same munificence that had been allowed to Mungo Park and 
 Laing, and intrusted with the mission of reaching Lake Chad. 
 At the request of Prussia, two Germans were added to the party, 
 one of whom was Doctor Barth. 
 
 All his companions having died one after the other, Barth 
 was left to fulfil the mission alone. After exploring the basin of 
 Lake Chad, and discovering the Benue, he pursued the Bournou 
 and Sokoto route, passed Say, crossed the valley of the Niger 
 from south to north, and arrived at Timbuctoo on August 29th, 
 1853. 
 
 His journey was greatly facilitated by his position as English 
 ambassador, and by the rich presents with which he was enabled 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 to sustain the part. His position at Timbuctoo, however, was 
 extremely critical. There are people still living in the city who 
 remember seeing Barth, or rather Abdel Kerim ( ; the servant of 
 the Lord "% as he called himself, and I gathered some interesting 
 details from them. 
 
 The explorer had counted upon staying at Timbuctoo with a 
 sheikh named El Backay, whose importance had been boasted of 
 and greatly exaggerated to him, and which he in turn exaggerated 
 to Europe. The Backays belonged to the tribe of Kountas. 
 These Berbers, strongly infused with negro blood, were, two 
 centuries ago, still settled to the south of Timbuctoo, in the 
 neighbourhood of Kairwan. From there they emigrated to the 
 desert, spread along the route from Tunis to the Sudan, and 
 settled in Saharian Adrar, a rocky plateau to the north-east of 
 Timbuctoo, near the town of Mabruk. They have since drawn 
 nearer the Niger, and are now to be found in the valley east of 
 Timbuctoo, on both sides of the river. 
 
 The Backays were a family of marabuts and scholars, not 
 warriors, and none of them ever had the ' opportunity of mounting 
 the throne," 1 as Barth has affirmed. They were content to mount 
 the pulpit, and their learning and wisdom have been famous in the 
 desert for over a hundred years. The first to be mentioned in the 
 history of Timbuctoo was Sidi Moktar el Kabir, a man pious to 
 asceticism, in whose eyes smoking was an impurity. He wrote a 
 book entitled Tardifa Koubra (The Great Taraifa), which is still 
 in the possession of the Kountas, and would be a desirable book to 
 procure, for it contains several historical notices, I am told. 
 
 The fame of his wisdom was the cause of his being called to 
 Timbuctoo in the early part of the present century. The last of 
 the Roumas were living on exceedingly bad terms with the 
 Touaregs, and Sidi Moktar, on being invited to adjust their 
 
EUROPE AND TIMBUCTOO 339 
 
 disputes, settled the tribute to be paid to the veiled men, and the 
 terms to be observed by them in return. He acted as mediator in 
 other circumstances, and his fame and the number of his pupils 
 steadily increased. On his death (1811) every one said, ' He was a 
 saint ' ; a little chapel was built upon his grave, and pilgrimages 
 were made to his tomb, which still stands on the dunes east of 
 Timbuctoo. 
 
 His son, Sidi Mohammed, maintained the family reputation, 
 and died in 1826, leaving several children, the eldest of whom was 
 called Sidi Moktar. The latter also played the part of peace- 
 maker which had been so well sustained by his grandfather. 
 When the Foulbes took possession of Timbuctoo, the populace 
 appealed to him to intercede for them with Cheikou Ahmadou. 
 He succeeded in satisfying both parties so well that the town 
 offered him a large dwelling, the Foulbe king overwhelmed him 
 with gifts and attentions, and he definitely quitted Adrar for 
 Timbuctoo. He was consulted in all disputes between Moors and 
 Touaregs, all controversies between the town and its nomadic 
 neighbours were submitted to his judgment, and he became the 
 recognised arbitrator of these countries. He had no public 
 function, and filled no official post, but was merely a great 
 marabut, enjoying universal consideration, receiving numerous 
 presents from pious people, giving excellent lectures, and followed 
 by many pupils from the Sudan and desert. He, too, was a man 
 of the pen, and composed a history of the Kounta Touaregs and 
 other desert tribes, which he called the Tardifa Sochora, or Little 
 Taraifa. 
 
 On his death in 1847, his son Ahmadi, the child of a slave, 
 succeeded to this honourable and lucrative post, but was ousted by 
 his uncle. The disputes between the two rivals irritated the 
 Foulbe king, who was full of reverence for the defunct, and 
 
340 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 greatly diminished the prestige of the family in Timbuctoo. 
 Now, the ambitious uncle was none other than Sheik El Backay, 
 who, having finally got the better of his nephew, endeavoured to 
 restore the family reputation and make himself famous by travelling 
 in the neighbouring countries. He was sojourning in Gundam 
 when the explorer reached Timbuctoo in 1853. 
 
 Barth was evidently under the impression that El Backay 
 occupied some commanding position in Timbuctoo. This is the 
 only possible explanation of the attitude he adopted upon his 
 arrival, and his singular want of tact which led to so many 
 disagreeables. Contrary to custom, he visited neither the chief 
 of the town nor the authorities, but contented himself with 
 settling in one of the shiek's houses and awaiting his return there. 
 The town was offended by this want of respect, and so much 
 hostility was displayed that the European was warned not to 
 venture out. This state of affairs lasted a month, and all Barth 
 saw of Timbuctoo was the view of the town he enjoyed from the 
 roof of his house. 
 
 Instead of improving, the situation became more critical with 
 the return of El Backay. In 1853 Timbuctoo formed, as we 
 know, a part of the Foulbe empire, and the local authorities had 
 hastened to send a message to Hamadallai, the residence of 
 Ahmadou Ahmadou, to inform him of the arrival of the traveller. 
 Greatly affronted that an ambassador should go to Timbuctoo 
 without offering him homage or the customary presents, without 
 asking permission to enter one of his towns, nor even informing 
 him of his presence, the king sent an order that the stranger 
 should be taken and brought to him. The arrival of this 
 command, with a troop of soldiery charged to execute it, 
 coincided, happily for Barth, with the return of the sheik. 
 
 El Backay, greatly flattered by receiving an ambassador,

 seeing all the lost prestige he could recover, and delighted to play 
 a trick upon the government which had crossed his ambition, 
 formally and very courageously took Earth under his protection. 
 6 The stranger is in my hand. You must cut it off before you can 
 take him,' was 
 the haughty re- 
 sponse he made 
 to the envoys. 
 The whole of 
 Timbuctoo was 
 confounded by 
 this incident. 
 The authorities 
 made many vain 
 attempts to in- 
 duce El Backay 
 to reconsider his 
 decision, and it 
 was finally deter- 
 mined to attack 
 protector and 
 protected, and 
 carry away the 
 latter by force. The two then quitted the town together, and 
 took refuge in a neighbouring camp. Backay was compelled to 
 call the worst enemies of the city to his assistance, and it was to 
 the Touaregs that Barth owed his escape from the fate of Laing 
 and his safe return to Europe. 
 
 From the day of his arrival to the hour of his departure, the 
 explorer lived in Timbuctoo like a prisoner. He was confined 
 to one house with his own and his host's servants perpetually 
 
 PLAN OF TIMBUCTOO 
 
342 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 on guard. He was unable to explore the town or even take an 
 hour's walk in its streets, and all he saw of them were the few 
 he passed through as, surrounded by an escort, he left the city 
 to take refuge in the desert from the hostility of the populace. 
 He only knew Timbuctoo through the eyes of his servants and 
 other people of that class, and that is why this portion of his 
 book is so deceptive and, in spite of its length, vague and empty. 
 It consists of copious details of his anxieties, his hopes and fears 
 for his life ; and its few interesting passages are swamped in an 
 ocean of tiresome details, according to the method of German 
 scholars. Instead of showing us some new aspect of the Mysteri- 
 ous City, he rails at his servants like a peevish housewife and 
 entertains us again and again with the health of his camels. 
 Rene Caillie saw, questioned, and observed an astonishing amount 
 during his fourteen days" stay in Timbuctoo, and gathered an 
 incomparably richer harvest than did Earth in his sojourn of a 
 month. On comparing the two accounts, one sees that Earth's 
 utterances are mere amplifications of the facts acquired by his 
 predecessor. 
 
 After this we are somewhat surprised to see Earth, from his 
 height of Doctor, treating Rene Caillie as an ' altogether incapable 
 man ' ; l and surprise turns to stupefaction when he assumes that 
 ' no one has been as well able as himself to represent the town 
 and its inhabitants in their true aspect.' 2 It is another example 
 of the old saying, that one may have great learning and little 
 wit. Rene Caillie has given us far more than we could expect 
 from a man who only knew how to read and write, a poor fellow 
 who had not enough to eat most of his days, and was tormented 
 by scurvy ; while Earth on the contrary did not, in Timbuctoo 
 at least, fulfil the promise of his great reputation.

EUROPE AND TIMBUCTOO 343 
 
 He had his excuses however; circumstances prevented his 
 seeing more of the town than its roofs, and deprived him of 
 any knowledge of its inhabitants. Public feeling was against 
 him. El Backay was in revolt against the authorities of the 
 town and its Foulbe king, and both he and his guest were 
 avoided by the people. Barth lived in the society of a stranger 
 sheik and his brothers, the chiefs of the Touaregs, Foulbes, 
 Berabichs, and other people of the desert, who were equally 
 strangers to the town. This explains how it was that he was 
 unable to procure any of the literary works of the city, and 
 remained ignorant of the real author of the Tarik in a town in 
 which it was known to all. He had to be content with extracts, 
 hastily copied from an example at Gando, from which he com- 
 posed his historical chapter (the only new thing in his book); 
 and he so completely confuses the history of the Songhoi with 
 that of Timbuctoo that, in his hands, the amusing and picturesque 
 Chronicle of the Sudan becomes something unutterably flat and 
 tiresome. We surely had a right to expect something better 
 from the accredited scholar who was so exacting towards one 
 who had been educated in an elementary school. 
 
 We have seen that El Backay's house to-day is a mere heap 
 of ruins ; this is not the case, however, with the one next door, 
 which his hospitality offered to Barth. This dwelling remains 
 exactly as it was described by the explorer, and it is to be hoped 
 that it will be as carefully preserved as that of Rene Caillie. 
 Timbuctoo has none too many relics of the Europeans, and, 
 everything considered, there is no need to look harshly on the 
 memory of Barth. His surly disposition and his infatuation 
 must have caused him disagreeables enough in his lifetime, and 
 
344 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 Europeans at Timbuctoo remember with gratitude that he was 
 the first to follow the course of the eastern Niger to Say, and 
 to clear up the vast geographical regions surrounding Lake 
 Chad. 
 
 I also found traces of Barth in his character of ambassador. 
 On his return to Europe he set before the English a scheme of 
 
 EARTH'S HOUSE 
 
 penetration in the direction of Timbuctoo which was based upon 
 an exaggerated notion of the authority of El Backay. The 
 shorter routes, those of Algeria and Senegal, being in the pos- 
 session of France, he advocated reaching the city by way of the 
 Niger, starting from its mouth. He laid great stress upon the 
 value of El Backay's support to an English enterprise, a view 
 which was the more readily accepted by the Government as the 
 
EUROPE AND TIMBUCTOO 345 
 
 progress France was making in Southern Algeria was causing 
 them much anxiety. 
 
 The capture of Timbuctoo gave some curious documents into 
 our hands. They have not been edited, and we give them in 
 their entirety, for they display English plans and methods with- 
 out any need of commentary. 
 
 LETTER I 
 LETTER FROM LORD CLARENDON TO SHEIK EL BACKAY. 
 
 Praise be to God ! May He be glorified ! 
 
 On the part of Clarendon, Minister to the Queen and Govern- 
 ment of England, to the greatly honoured and very noble Sheik, 
 the learned among scholars who shines by his intelligence, Sidi 
 Mohamed El Backay, ben Sidi Mohamed, ben Sidi Mokhar El 
 Kounti ; to whom we address our thanks and the expression of our 
 consideration. May God reward him ! So be it ! 
 
 Salutation be with you. 
 
 May God accord you His mercy and blessing with the purest 
 of His graces ! 
 
 I would have you know that the Queen of England has heard the 
 report of Doctor Barth (named Abdel Kerim among the Arabs), who 
 visited you at her command, in your country," to renew the friendship 
 existing between you and us, and to make you known to her. Barth 
 has made known to us the goodwill with which you received him 
 and which can never be forgotten. You have protected him from 
 a faithless people who were unable to distinguish good from evil 
 (may God reward you for the good actions His law recommended to 
 you ! ). He has informed us of your strength and courage, and we 
 have felt great joy thereat. 
 
 The letters you sent by him have arrived. We have read them 
 and well understand what they contain. It has been a great pleasure 
 to us. The hopes of the English Government have been understood 
 by you. What we wish is to open the eyes of the Arabs of the 
 
346 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 south to commerce and all appertaining to it, and we are now aware 
 that you have looked upon our mission with pleasure and have 
 accepted our friendship with joy. 
 
 We have given you our word that the friendship binding us shall 
 not diminish through the centuries, and that all that the Arabs require 
 of us we will do, without increase or diminishment. We will assist 
 them in all that they are unable to perform, and as our government 
 is very powerful we will protect your people who turn to us, above 
 all with the aid of your Lordship, who have long shown your power 
 and your friendship for us. 
 
 The Queen experienced great joy when she knew the benefits with 
 which you loaded Abdel Kerim, who was enabled to return in peace 
 owing to your reception and the honours with which you surrounded 
 him, and she sends you presents of products manufactured in 
 England. 
 
 These presents have been packed in cases and sent to the Consul- 
 general of Tripoli, who will send them on to you. God grant that 
 they may arrive safely and in good condition, and that they may 
 please and rejoice you. 
 
 We request and recommend you to say to the chief of the Aoule- 
 midens and the chief of the Tademekkats, that the Queen of England 
 has received the letters sent by them to her through Abdel Kerim. 
 We have all been pleased by them. She begs you to say to these 
 chiefs that she salutes them and sends them a poignard and a sabre, 
 the poignard for one, and the sabre for the other. You will easily 
 recognise these objects, for the name of the recipient is written upon 
 each. 
 
 To conclude this letter, we wish to say to you that our joy would 
 be great to see one of your people, above all a child of your own 
 house, whose visit would honour us. We wish to show him our power, 
 our manufactures, and many other things. 
 
 May God prolong your life and preserve you to live. 
 
 Your friend, 
 
 CLARENDON, 
 
 Minuter of the English Government. 
 LONDON, the fifteenth day of April 1859.

 LETTER II 
 
 LETTER FROM THE ENGLISH CONSUL AT" TRIPOLI TO EL BACKAY. 
 
 Praise be to the one God ! May God grant His blessing to him 
 after whom there was no longer a Prophet (otherwise Mahomet) ! 
 
 To our friend the noble Lord, the very high, very learned, very 
 complete Sidi Ahmed Backay. 
 
 May our greeting reach him with the expression of our considera- 
 tion. 
 
 You will find in this letter an epistle from the minister Clarendon, 
 with a translation in Arabic. It is written in reply to the letter 
 received by you. 
 
 When you have read this letter you will know that the English Govern- 
 ment has sent a steamer up the river that flows out of your country, and has 
 recommended those on board to make every effort to reach you. Watch 
 for them. We desire to unite ourselves in friendship with the people of 
 your country, and make ourselves known to you, above all at Timbuctoo 
 where you live. We ask God to assist us in this task because it will 
 result in great good^to your country and to us also. 
 
 The son of your sister, Sidi Mohamed, and the people of his 
 retinue are well. He is with me at this moment, awaiting the 
 presents the Government is sending him, and the writings which 
 seal the friendship existing between you and us. 
 
 Our Government has already given Sidi Mohamed the choice 
 between several things. They would send a boat to take him to 
 them, or they would reward him here and return him to you, or he 
 could stay with me till the end of the winter and the beginning of 
 the spring, when a boat could take him to England. Sidi Mohamed 
 decides to return from here, and this is also preferred by my Govern- 
 ment, for we fear the effect of the cold of our climate upon his health. 
 This cold is very great, etc. 
 
 (Signature illegible.) 
 
 The boat mentioned never did reach Timbuctoo, nor did El 
 Backay visit England and see its manufactures. Lord Clarendon's 
 
EUROPE AND TIMBUCTOO 349 
 
 great joy" was of short duration, and his hopes resulted in 
 nothing. 
 
 After the departure of Barth, his protector had no leisure to 
 give to the plans which had been sketched between them ; he was 
 entirely occupied in taking care of himself. The generous attitude 
 which had popularised him with Europe had greatly complicated 
 his position in Timbuctoo. His very strained relations with the 
 Foulbe authorities, and the suspicion with which the inhabitants 
 regarded a protege of the Touaregs obliged him to maintain a 
 good deal of reserve. 
 
 The most critical period of the Sudan was now approaching, 
 and the Toucouleur invasion was spreading from south to north. 
 El Hadj Omar had marched from victory to victory, and was now 
 menacing the Foulbe empire (1860). Ahmadou Ahmadou naively 
 sought to avert the peril by opposing a man of religion to one 
 who, to justify his massacres, posed as a reformer, and Sheik 
 El Backay reappeared on the scenes. He was exhorted to inter- 
 vene as mediator between the kingdom and the new Prophet, but, 
 remembering the former harshness of the Foulbe monarch, he 
 at first refused. Afterwards, however, he addressed a message of 
 peace to El Hadj, which he accompanied with several presents. 
 For all reply the conquering Toucouleur ironically invited the 
 sheik to hasten with his homage, to which El Backay responded 
 by a satire in verse on the false Prophet. Ahmadou Ahmadou 
 had perished meanwhile, and the Toucouleurs were installed in 
 his capital of Hamadallai. One of their columns, entering Tim- 
 buctoo under the command of Alpha Omar, pillaged the town 
 and sacked the house of El Backay. 
 
 After a while the sheik decided to return from the desert, 
 in which he had sought shelter, and at his instigation Touaregs 
 and Kountas joined the fray. Alpha Omar's column was surprised 
 
TIMBUCTOO 
 
 by night and totally destroyed, and the conquerors, reinforced 
 by Foulbes, besieged El Hadj Omar in Hamadallai. The Tou- 
 couleur peril was averted, but dissension now spread among the 
 troops, and El Backay quitted Timbuctoo to establish peace. 
 Before reaching Hamadallai, however, he fell ill at a little village, 
 on the right bank of the Niger, called Saradina, and died there 
 eight days afterwards (1864). 
 
 Abbidin, who was his favourite son, according to Barth, 
 attempted to assume his father's position at Timbuctoo, but in 
 vain, for neither Touaregs nor inhabitants would have anything 
 to do with him. He then attempted a political role in the 
 countries of the Deltas, and finally relapsed into brigandage ; 
 pillaging and terrorising the shores of the Black and White Niger, 
 under the pretext of fighting the Touaregs. He was killed by 
 the latter as he was making a pilgrimage to his father's tomb 
 in 1890. 
 
 Such was the history of the Backays up to the moment of 
 our arrival in Timbuctoo. It is the story of the decline of a great 
 and noble family of the desert. I will mention one more some- 
 what remarkable episode. Barth awoke at Berlin one morning 
 under the impression that he must write to General Faidherbe, 
 the governor of Senegal, and recommend the Backays to him in 
 case one or other of them should require assistance. He sent the 
 letter, and at the precise moment of its arrival in St. Louis, Oulad 
 Backay had been arrested as a spy, and was on the point of being 
 condemned to death by a court-martial. Faidherbe naturally 
 acquitted the prisoner, and thus Earth's and England's debt was 
 repaid. 
 
 Two of the sheik's sons, namely, Baba Ahmed and Bai, were 
 still living when we entered Timbuctoo. They had returned to 
 the Saharian Adrar, the cradle of their family, and settled at 
 
EUROPE AND TIMBUCTOO 
 
 351 
 
 Tached-Ait (the mountain of stone), a ten days' journey from 
 Timbuctoo. All traces of the influence their forefathers exercised 
 over the Touaregs had disappeared, and they were living on 
 exceedingly bad terms with their neighbours, the Touaregs of Air. 
 Ahmed, grandson of the sheik, lives at Gourbo on the Niger, 
 and seems to wish to restore the prestige of the family. He 
 addressed a letter to the French authorities, asking if they were 
 disposed to ratify the good relations established by Barth. He 
 was answered in the affirmative, but his situation is so precarious 
 that he will scarcely be of much use to us. A solitary Backay, 
 Ahmadi-Alouata, occupies a modest position in Timbuctoo, and 
 is on the best of terms with the authorities. 
 
CHAPTER XVI 
 
 THE FRENCH CONQUEST 
 
 UP to the last moment England endeavoured to put her hand 
 upon the commerce of Timbuctoo. Failing in her efforts from 
 Tripoli and the Niger's mouth, she attempted to secure a footing 
 by way of Morocco, and was installed towards 1890 at Cape Juby. 
 It was then too late. Our columns and posts had been slowly 
 advancing by the Senegal route advocated by Colbert, and in 
 1893 Colonel Archinard took Jenne, the last halting-place but 
 one. The following year we were at Timbuctoo, and Cape Juby 
 was evacuated. 
 
 Whatever may have been said at the time, the occupation 
 of Timbuctoo was not only necessary, but had to be effected 
 with the least possible delay. No one can complain now that 
 we have not made known the history of these people and their 
 country. The prosperity of the Sudan is so closely connected 
 with that of its principal market, that if the general anarchy had 
 been prolonged in Timbuctoo all the sacrifices of human life and 
 money we had made on her threshold would have remained sterile. 
 The sooner an end was put to the ruinous dominion of the 
 Touaregs the better would it be. What would have become of 
 the town if the French occupation had been prevented ? We can 
 easily picture the scene : the Touaregs would assemble and unite 
 with Kountas, Foulbes, and Moors, as they did thirty years ago 
 
 352 
 
THE FRENCH CONQUEST 353 
 
 against the Toucouleurs at the instigation of El Backay. The 
 routes from Morocco, Tuat, and Tripoli would have left the 
 Sudan (that enormous country which we occupy with such modest 
 means) open to foreign intrigues, to the introduction of arms and 
 ammunition, and to fanatics led by some inspired marabut, to a 
 second El Hadj Omar returned from Mecca, or to some Mahdi 
 come from Tuat. The result of long years of struggle and effort 
 would be destroyed in a few months, our patient work of regenera- 
 tion and pacification would be hopelessly compromised, and the 
 flames of revolt which would break out in Timbuctoo would rapidly 
 spread to Algeria. The seat of so many perils, the key to all 
 the routes of the Sahara and Sudan, must be in our hands as 
 soon as possible. 
 
 These dangers were dissipated/ by the promptitude of our 
 march on Timbuctoo. All homage to Colonel Archinard, who 
 knew so well the country and people with whom he had to deal. 
 By his alacrity the colony was spared fresh convulsions and the 
 capital great sacrifices. No sooner was Jenne taken, than, with 
 remarkable intuition, he traced the plan of the succeeding cam- 
 paign. A forced march was to be made on Timbuctoo to prevent 
 any concentration of the nomads, one column traversing the 
 countries on the left bank of the Niger, another advancing by 
 of the river as the gunboats cleared the passage. Such 
 were the tactics pursued at the end of 1894. Colonel Bonnier 
 conducted one of the columns, Colonel Jouffre the second, while 
 Lieutenant Boiteux commanded the flotilla. Unfortunately 
 Colonel Archinard was not there to conduct the campaign ; had 
 he been, the unfortunate episodes which marred its execution 
 would probably have been averted. 
 
 I am now going to show the taking of Timbuctoo in a new 
 light, as it appeared to the inhabitants. They related it to me 
 
354 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 as the old Sudanese chroniclers, whose art is unhappily lost, might 
 have done. 
 
 From the beginning of November 1894 vague rumours were 
 afloat in Timbuctoo, reports of a mustering of troops at Segu. 
 The country being quiet on their side, the inhabitants conjectured 
 it to be some expedition preparing for the north. Three weeks 
 passed without any news, and then suddenly events took shape. 
 A merchant, who arrived from the south, announced that the 
 gunboats had reached Sarafara and were preparing to start for 
 Kabara. They had taken on board, as pilots, two of the leading 
 merchants of Timbuctoo, who were in exile at Sarafara, having 
 been ruined by the Touaregs. The next day news came of the 
 arrival of the flotilla at Koriouma. 
 
 A body of Tenguaragif Touaregs were in Timbuctoo, and they 
 summoned Hamdia, the chief of the town, and ordered him to 
 have the tabala (war drum) sounded, and to command the people 
 to take up arms. The excitement was great, the population 
 being divided between fear of the French and terror of the 
 Touaregs ; some of the notables remonstrated with Hamdia, and 
 the Kountas alone showed any courage. However, all those who 
 had not hidden themselves in time had to set out in company 
 with the veiled men. This small army, of which the Touaregs 
 formed the cavalry, was armed with lances and javelins, and a few 
 rifles belonging chiefly to the Kountas. 
 
 As this army was marching to Kabara on the morning of 
 December 5th, the flotilla had left Koriouma, and was ascending 
 the Pool to Dai. There Commandant Boiteux and some Lap tots 
 (black sailors) disembarked in a lighter to reconnoitre the route to 
 Kabara, and gather sufficient information to acquaint the two 
 columns with the situation when they should arrive. But an 
 
THE FRENCH CONQUEST 355 
 
 incident occurred which upset their intended plans, and hastened 
 the capture of Timbuctoo in an unforeseen manner. 
 
 The approach of the lighter having been signalled at Kabara, 
 the Touaregs and Timbuctooans assembled on the banks, silent 
 and immovable. When the lighter appeared in sight a cloud of 
 lances and javelins greeted it, the Kountas discharged their guns, 
 and a general uproar took place. Only one shot carried, wound- 
 ing a laptot ; the rest had time to escape the javelins by crouch- 
 ing at the bottom of the boat. They replied with a volley which 
 wounded several, killed one, and put all to flight, the Touaregs to 
 the desert, and the Timbuctooans back to their city. 
 
 A few hours later the gunboats and lighters anchored in the 
 harbour of Kabara. 
 
 At Timbuctoo the authorities held council during the night. 
 ' What is to be done ' ? asked Hamdia, the chief. 
 
 ' Listen to my words and thought," replied the kadi. ' You 
 must write a letter to the commander, and say, " It is not we who 
 are responsible for what has happened at Kabara but the Toua- 
 regs, whom we fear. We, the people of Timbuctoo, are not 
 opposed to your arrival here, for you hold the countries from 
 which we draw our commerce and alimentation. We place our- 
 selves in your hands." This is my advice. 1 
 
 'I am afraid to do that, 1 replied Hamdia. 'The Touaregs 
 insulted me this morning by saying that we had written to the 
 white men asking them to come. They know that some of our 
 people are on their side." 1 
 
 ' The Touaregs do us nothing but harm : why listen to them ? ' 
 replied the kadi. ' We had better send a letter to Kabara. 1 
 
 'But the road is guarded. Our messengers would be taken 
 and killed. 1 
 
356 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 * You can get to Kabara by other than the main route.* 1 
 < So be it,' said Hamdia finally. ' Let us do as you say.' 
 The kadi drew up the letter, and wrote to the commander as 
 follows : 
 
 'We would have you to know that what took place this 
 morning was done without our sanction. We only took part 
 under compulsion from the Touaregs, and we fled as soon as we 
 could. Our united resolution was this. When, a month ago, we 
 learnt of the arrival of your troops at Segu, some Arab merchants 
 counselled us to write to our former master, the Sultan of 
 Morocco, and ask him what we were to do if the white men came. 
 The messengers set out for Fez with a caravan. The route is 
 
 GENERAL VIEW OF FORT BONNIER 
 
 long, and they have not yet returned. We are women. We do 
 not fight. 1 
 
 Two messengers, who were bribed with a hundred yards of 
 white linen to go to Kabara, immediately set out. Before sunrise 
 they returned. One of the Timbuctooans, who accompanied the 
 gunboats, had read and translated the kadi's letter to the white 
 man's interpreter, and then written the following answer in the 
 commandant's name : 
 
 'I know that all the mounted men and those armed with 
 
THE FRENCH CONQUEST 357 
 
 lances were Touaregs, but those who had guns were natives of 
 Timbuctoo. Why did you attack us before you knew what we 
 wished? It is not thus you should receive people with whose 
 intentions you are not acquainted. Ours were for your good. 
 But what is past is past ; to-morrow send some of your chiefs for 
 a palaver." 
 
 Early in the morning of the next day the Touaregs returned to 
 Timbuctoo. They were questioned by one of the notables, Alpha 
 Saidou, the chief of the Ghingaraber quarter. 
 
 6 We pay you taxes, therefore you ought to defend us. Here 
 are the white men. What do you intend doing ? ' 
 
 ' Do as you like,' they replied. ' The Tenguaragifs are not the 
 only masters here. Other tribes share the tax with us, and our 
 people ought not to be the only ones to be slaughtered. Besides, 
 we have just learned that a column is coming from the west, the 
 Gundam quarter, where our flocks and wives are. We want to 
 protect them, and we are going.'' 
 
 The Touaregs having left the town, the chiefs and notables 
 assembled in the mosque of Sidi Yaia after the sunset prayer. 
 They decided to accede to the commandant's wish, and two delegates 
 were chosen. The letter which accredited them repeated that they 
 were merchants and not combatants, and that if the commandant 
 would wait for the sultan's answer all would be well ; but if not, he 
 was at liberty to do just what he pleased ; he would not be opposed 
 by the people. However, the delegates came back ; one, a Tripolitan 
 chosen by the Arab merchants, would not do. The commandant, 
 would not treat with a stranger, but only with the natives. He 
 was replaced by an influential marabut, Mohaman Kouti, the 
 other delegate being Alpha Saidou. From that time negotiations 
 opened very amicably with Kabara, the delegates frankly explaining 
 the situation and announcing the exodus of the Touaregs. The 
 
358 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 commandant received them courteously, told them that two 
 armies were following him up, and demanded that a treaty of 
 peace should be signed by the chief and authorities of the town 
 placing the country under the protectorate of France. But no 
 one in Timbuctoo dared give his signature. The town was dis- 
 mayed, every one feared the return of the Touaregs, knowing that 
 in that case his signature would cost him his head. 
 
 According to a local legend, the Niger has an exceptionally 
 high and early rise in those years when some remarkable event, 
 generally sinister, is to take place, such as war, epidemic, or famine. 
 For thirty years no one remembered to have seen so much water 
 in the pool that winds from Kabara to Timbuctoo. M. Boiteux 
 decided to hasten the negotiations, and arrived at Timbuctoo, by 
 means of the pool of Kabara, with two lighters armed with revolv- 
 ing guns, borrowed from the gunboats. 
 
 And thus it was that Timbuctoo, a town nearly eight hundred 
 miles from the sea a town of the Sahara, moreover, was taken 
 by sailors, thus equalling the feat of Jourdan*s Hussars, who took 
 possession of the Dutch fleet among the ice of the Zuyder Zee. 
 
 It was December 15th. The evening before, the two delegates 
 had been sent back to Timbuctoo to prepare it for the events 
 which were to follow. During the night, the lighters, manned by 
 eighteen men, had crossed the sands without hindrance, and were 
 before Timbuctoo by the morning. On hearing this, some forty 
 of the besieged, Foulbes and Kountas mostly, took up arms ; but 
 the authorities compelled them to put them down, threatening 
 to stir up the mob against them if they did not. The chiefs then 
 proceeded to the banks of the pool, taking with them gifts of 
 welcome. ' Are you bringing me the treaty of peace I demanded ? " 
 asked Commandant Boiteux. 6 No," the chief replied, ' for we only 
 
THE FRENCH CONQUEST 359 
 
 heard of your arrival last night. 1 ' Then I cannot accept your 
 gifts, 1 said M. Boiteux, ' and I have nothing further to say to you. 
 You know my wish ; I made it known to your two envoys.' 
 
 As the deputation retired one of the guns was landed and 
 planted on a neighbouring dune, which was rapidly transformed 
 into a redoubt ; the other was left on board the lighter, to cover 
 any eventual retreat. 
 
 The presence of the little troop, and, above all, the two cannon 
 (whose terrible power was known to them), reassured the authorities 
 as to the return of the Touaregs, and gave them courage for a 
 final resolution. They assembled their notables and marabuts at 
 the mosque, and, the three o'clock prayer having been recited, 
 Kouati, the most influential marabut, stood up and said, ' What 
 have you all to say ? 1 
 
 ' But what have you to say ? ' the assembly replied. 
 
 ' 1 ? Oh, I am not one of the authorities/ 
 
 ' Certainly. But you are a marabut, you have the word of 
 God. Speak ! speak ! ' 
 
 'This is my thought," Kouati then said. 'All those who will 
 not make peace will be responsible in the Judgment Day for the 
 souls of those who get killed. 1 
 
 ' We will do as you counsel us. 1 
 
 4 1 am not the only marabut in Timbuctoo, 1 Kouati objected. 
 ' Question my brethren. 1 
 
 ' What Mohaman Kouati says is true, 1 opined the brethren. 
 
 'It is well, 1 concluded Kouati. 'I am going to make peace 
 with the French. 1 
 
 And then he went to the lighters with Alpha Saidou, who 
 had accompanied him to Kabara, and said to the commandant, 
 ' We ask for peace. We will accept it, and do all you wish. 
 Henceforth we are with you. 1 
 
360 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 ' Your decision gives me much pleasure, 1 M. Boitetix assured 
 them. ' We do not like making war, we prefer peace. It was the 
 Toucouleurs who first fired at Jenne ; had it not been for that, we 
 should not have fired a shot. In future, you have nothing to fear. 
 Sign the treaty by which you recognise the French as masters of 
 the town, and I, on my side, will sign one which will place you 
 under our protection." 
 
 The next morning, the two treaties having been exchanged 
 in the presence of the chiefs and marabuts, they implored the 
 commandant to enter and occupy the town, explaining their fear 
 of reprisals from the Touaregs, and assuring him that henceforth 
 he could in all things count upon them. They loyally informed 
 him that the besieged had taken up arms, and they undertook to 
 keep them under surveillance, and to acquaint him with all that 
 went on inside and outside the city. 
 
 M. Boiteux requested them to show him the highest point of 
 the city, and there he selected a large house. One of the guns 
 was hoisted on to the terrace, and the surrounding walls were 
 temporarily put into a state of defence. This improvised fortlet 
 was at the north of the town, where a real fort, occupied by a 
 squadron of Spahis, now stands. At the south of the town 
 another house was transformed in the same manner, and the 
 second gun was placed there, while the handful of Europeans 
 and Laptots were stationed in between, and some fifty men, 
 armed with guns furnished by the town, were posted as sentinels. 
 
 In the meantime the Touaregs had plotted with, and been 
 joined by, some Kountas. On December 21st they attacked the 
 flotilla reserve station at Kabara. It was on this occasion the 
 sad episode occurred which cost Midshipman Aube his life. At 
 the moment he was dying at Our* Oumaira, the sentinels at 
 Timbuctoo, having heard rifle-shots, had given the alarm. The 
 
THE FRENCH CONQUEST 
 
 361 
 
 only two horses in the town were brought out, Commandant 
 Boiteux mounted one, another European the other, and, accom- 
 panied by the little garrison and the fifty natives, they set off in 
 all haste to Kabara. They routed the Touaregs, 
 who fled, leaving fifteen of their number dead. 
 
 The enemy mustered again in the night, and 
 were seen in the day-time passing the town. Being 
 greeted with shot, they dispersed, some to block the 
 road to Kabara on the south, 
 while others installed themselves 
 to the north of the city. The 
 
 ENTRANCE TO FORT BONNIER 
 
 next night they sent a letter to the kadi couched in the following 
 terms : ' People of Timbuctoo, are you for us, or for the white 
 men ? ' The messenger was sent back with no other answer than 
 having seen the letter torn in pieces and spat upon. At the 
 same time, an inhabitant of the city arrived who had been made 
 prisoner by the Touaregs, and had escaped under cover of the 
 darkness. He told the Timbuctooans that at a council of the 
 Touaregs, N'-Gouna, chief of the Tenguaragifs, had proposed 
 
362 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 marching on Timbuctoo, but had been opposed by the chiefs of 
 the Kalintassars. 
 
 The commandant was immediately warned, and the alarm 
 given to the inhabitants, who feared an attack in the dark, 
 according to the usual custom of the veiled men. Every one 
 was armed ; even the strangers of Mossi, who had been recently 
 exploited by the Touaregs, seized their bows and arrows. They 
 were posted east and west, while the two fortlets guarded north 
 and south. 
 
 As day broke they could see bands passing from east to west, 
 but not daring to approach when they saw the muster. The 
 divisions among the Touaregs increased ; the Kalintassars, who 
 had not wished to attack Timbuctoo, returned to their homes, 
 and only the Tenguaragifs remained, and they seized the road to 
 Kabara with the intention of starving the town. 
 
 They calculated well. About January 6th the garrison found 
 the provisions were running short. Whatever happened, they 
 must revictual from Kabara. The commandant resolved to use 
 the path by which he had come ; so, in the night, the two lighters, 
 armed afresh with the revolving guns and a few men, glided out 
 unperceived. However, they could not get back before daylight, 
 and the Touaregs, having discovered them, assembled in a mass on 
 the shores where the banks of the pool narrowed. As they were 
 preparing to fling their javelins, the guns were unmasked, and a 
 charge of grape-shot saluted them. The Touaregs had not 
 noticed the departure of the lighters, and thinking that reinforce- 
 ments had arrived, they fled to the interior westward of the town, 
 and the road to Timbuctoo was free. 
 
 Four days later, January 10th, the first column, under 
 command of Colonel Bonnier, entered the town, and thus ended 
 the extraordinary adventure of the marines in Timbuctoo. 
 
THE FRENCH CONQUEST 
 
 363 
 
 I have transcribed, word for word, the naive account given me 
 by those ebony and bronze men who were either the chief actors 
 or chief spectators in this action. My one care has been to 
 simplify their narrative and avoid any embellishments, yet I doubt 
 if, in modern times, there has been any event as improbable. The 
 gravity of heroic drama is mingled with the fun of an operetta, 
 buffoonery wrestles with the sublime. Not even the unhealthy 
 imagination of Edgar Poe ever conceived anything more fantastic. 
 
 It is so preposterous on the face of it. Nineteen men, seven 
 of whom are Europeans and the remainder Senegalese negroes, set 
 out to bring to terms a town of 8000 inhabitants, and are asked 
 to take possession of it. And this town is no African Lauderneau : 
 it is Timbuctoo the Great, known as a mysterious, fanatical, 
 
 FORT PHILIPPE 
 
 inaccessible city. Events follow in crescendo. The population 
 sides with its masters of to-day against those of yesterday. One 
 day they are ' women," the next they are heroes ready to die in 
 defence of their conquerors, and, what is more, they prove it ! 
 These Touaregs, whom formerly they had not dared to look in the 
 face, they now fight in the open country. And, more astonishing 
 still, they beat them ! This dishevelled epopee, this mingling of 
 
364 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 cavalry and artillery with naval combats and pictures of siege, 
 does not last for one or several days, it is prolonged for a month. 
 In fact, one is surprised not to see the green-eyed Pallas Athene, 
 or the white-armed Venus, appearing in the plain of Timbuctoo to 
 protect the combatants and inflame them with warlike ardour, 
 while Apollo of the silver bow brings the others to confusion with 
 his arrows. But no, this is no fable ; it has all been lived in our 
 notoriously prosaic nineteenth century. Why should such a 
 glorious and amusing quip be followed by so sinister an epilogue ? 
 The actors are the first column and those same Touaregs 
 whom just now we left to the west of Timbuctoo. The story has 
 been written by M. Raille, one of the garrison officers in 
 Timbuctoo, who collected the facts from the survivors. 
 
 The morning after their entry into Timbuctoo, Colonel 
 Bonnier, without further delay, ordered the fifth company and a 
 platoon of the eleventh to set out and reconnoitre, that they 
 might rid the neighbourhood of the nomads infesting it, and 
 avenge, if possible, the massacre of Midshipman Aube. 
 
 At five o'clock in the morning, leaving the rest of the troops 
 under the command of Captain Philippe, the colonel started with 
 the little column. He was accompanied by Commander Hugueny, 
 Captains Regad, Livrelli, Tassard, Sensaric, and Nigote, Lieu- 
 tenants Gamier and Bouverst, Sub-lieutenant Sarda, Doctor 
 Colonel Gallas, the veterinary Lenoir, and interpreter Acklouck. 
 
 It was the 14th of January 1894. At two o'clock in the 
 afternoon Colonel Bonnier learnt that the Touaregs were distant 
 only a mile or two in front of the column. They continued 
 marching until eight in the evening, and then they saw some 
 flocks and a few armed men. After giving chase to the stragglers, 
 they encamped at a place called Taconbao, which had just been 
 
THE FRENCH CONQUEST 365 
 
 evacuated by the Touaregs. Every one was satisfied and 
 cheerful. 
 
 They encamped, as nearly as possible, in the form of a square, 
 the men of the fifth company occupying the north, and those of 
 the eleventh company the south side. Every one slept rolled up 
 in his blanket with his arms piled near. On the other two sides 
 the captured flocks were picketed. The prisoners were installed in 
 the middle of the camp, while the staff formed a group in the 
 middle of the square towards the east side, where the colonel's 
 quarters were. 
 
 Until midnight the officers of the staff were awake, and 
 laughing and joking, having spent the evening gaily. At last 
 every one slept. It was a magnificent night, and the brilliant light 
 of the moon illuminated everything, until she set towards four 
 o'clock in the morning. At half-past four only the sentinels, of 
 whom there were six, were awake. The colonel himself gave the 
 orders to have them placed at a short distance from the camp. 
 Suddenly, in the midst of the silence and darkness, two reports of 
 firearms resounded through the camp, and the cry ' To arms ! ' 
 was repeated everywhere. Immediately every one was up, hurriedly 
 seeking his arms. Alas ! it was too late ! 
 
 The Touaregs, some of whom had been seen straggling round 
 the camp the evening before, had assembled during the night. 
 Their cavalry, accompanied by running footmen and favoured by 
 the darkness, flung themselves on to the French camp in a furious 
 and irresistible charge. In the twinkling of an eye they had 
 capsized the piled weapons and swarmed into the camp before any 
 one had had time to defend himself. 
 
 It was night indeed, and the frightful scene which ensued cannot 
 be depicted. It was a furious onslaught, an indescribable tumult. 
 Above everything sounded the warcries of the enemy, who were 
 
366 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 striking and killing on all sides with lances, assegais, sabres, 
 poignards, tomahawks, etc. A few rifle-shots mingled with the 
 clamour of distress, and that was all. 
 
 Our tirailleurs succumbed to this human avalanche. In a few 
 minutes it was all over. 
 
 Three Europeans, an officer and two non-commissioned officers 
 (Captain Nigote, Sergeant-Major Baretti, and Sergeant Lalire) and 
 a handful of men succeeded in forcing a passage and reaching 
 some bushes near the encampment. Captain Nigote collected the 
 fugitives in the midst of these unprecedented perils and difficulties, 
 and conducted them to the convoy which had been left behind. 
 There they were able to reform. 
 
 Eighty-two of our men and two guides were missing. Nine 
 officers, including the colonel, three non-commissioned officers (of 
 whom two were Europeans), eight corporals, and sixty native 
 tirailleurs, had fallen before the enemy. 
 
 As far as the survivors could judge in the darkness and tumult, 
 they had been attacked by about two hundred horsemen and 
 between two and three hundred foot-soldiers. 
 
 Twenty-five days afterwards, the second column, commanded 
 by Colonel Jouffre, arrived at Taconbao and collected the skeletons 
 of the thirteen Europeans, bringing them back to Timbuctoo. 
 They were buried behind an enclosure of dead thorns at the foot 
 of the fort which was being built to the south of the town. The 
 last solemn honours were rendered them before the whole garrison 
 and the assembled population, and modest mounds of sun-dried 
 bricks and simple black crosses were placed over the graves of 
 these unfortunate heroes. Then Colonel Jouffre turned his 
 thoughts to vengeance. He soon ascertained that the Tenguara- 
 gifs had settled between the Lakes Faguibine and Fati, not far 
 
 
THE FRENCH CONQUEST 
 
 367 
 
 from Gundam. They were surprised by night in their encamp- 
 ments, and our tirailleurs and Spahis slew a great number of them. 
 According to a saying of their own country, they paid the ransom 
 of blood. 
 
 Since we have avenged our dead, as the customs of the desert 
 
 - :, - 
 COLONEL BONNIER'S TOMB AT TIMBUCTOO 
 
 require, and since we possess the country and the markets from 
 which the Touaregs draw their supplies, their different tribes have 
 offered their submission. I will not affirm that this submission is 
 complete and definite. It will still be necessary from time to 
 time to show them that their nefarious dominion is at an end, and 
 that they have found their master. 
 
 Timbuctoo remained unwaveringly faithful through all these 
 
368 T I M B U C T O O 
 
 vicissitudes, true to the word given on the first day, ' We are for 
 you henceforth,' and it is easy to see that this allegiance will never 
 be withdrawn. 
 
 After waiting for it a year, the town received the sultan's 
 reply. The sovereign of Fez wrote as follows : 
 
 ' Praise be unto the one God. 
 
 ' May blessings and salutations be upon our Lord Mahomet, upon 
 his family, and upon his companions. 
 
 ( Greeting to the chief of the town and the notables. May God 
 accord you His favours, accompanied by His blessings and His 
 mercy. 
 
 ' I have paid great attention to the help and protection you ask 
 of me. I am greatly distressed. I should have responded to your 
 appeal and given you good support, but the great distance between 
 us compels me to be cautious. Your neighbours must come to your 
 assistance. 
 
 'I will march upon the French and drive them away from you, 
 but you must first send me proofs of your dependency on my high 
 government and my kingdom. If you possess writings emanating 
 from your ancestors (those generous ones who are already in the 
 Land of the Blessed), manifest and serious documents, send them 
 to me. With their help I will deliver you from everything by the 
 power and grace of the Most High God, who suffices unto the 
 afflicted and who comforts those who suffer, for He is All-powerful. 
 
 ' Salutation. 
 
 ' MOULAY EL HASSAN.' 
 
 And so faded their last and fondest illusions. As soon as 
 received, his majesty's letter was put into the hands of the 
 commandant of Timbuctoo, who delicately placed it in the 
 archives. 
 
 Two large forts have replaced the improvised fortifications, 
 and their guns command every side of the town. Under their 
 protection the inhabitants are reviving. The long nightmare 
 
THE FRENCH CONQUEST 
 
 369 
 
 of the Touaregs is being slowly dispelled, they are beginning to 
 repair and rebuild their houses, to leave the doors ajar, and to 
 resume their beautifully embroidered robes. 
 
 The town begins to show signs of European occupation. A 
 great, herculean negro plays the part of policeman, and pro- 
 menades the streets with a sabre at his side. An enterprising 
 merchant, Gaston Mery, has recently established a counting- 
 house, and he carries on an excellent business in the large and 
 comfortable house he has built there. Cardinal LavigenVs White 
 
 A HOUSE : TYPICAL OF TIMBUCTOO RESTORED 
 
 Fathers have arrived, led by Father Hacquard (a man well known 
 in Algeria), and, thanks to them, the town is already endowed 
 with a church (Our Lady of Timbuctoo) and a school. 
 
370 
 
 TIMBUCTOO 
 
 Such are the first days of the new era upon which Timbuctoo 
 has entered, and from which she will emerge more famous than 
 
 THE POLICEMAN AT TIMBUCTOO 
 
 ever ; for she possesses one thing which can never be destroyed, 
 and which ensures her perpetual greatness her unique geo- 
 graphical position on the threshold of the Sudan between the 
 eastern and western Niger, two arms which embrace the whole 
 of western Africa. 
 
THE FRENCH CONQUEST 371 
 
 I see Timbuctoo throwing aside her rags in the distant future, 
 and raising the form bent by misfortunes. The sandy pool of 
 Kabara will have been cleared and deepened, and the Niger 
 will have brought its abundant waters to the gates of the town. 
 It will be an easy task then to carry an arm to north and 
 east, and the town will be embraced by a girdle of cultivation. 
 Her gardens, her wealth of verdure, and her palm-trees will be 
 restored to her, and, threaded by shady walks, she will become 
 a pleasant and active cosmopolitan city, a point of union between 
 the black and white worlds. 
 
 The Sahara will be conquered ; an iron chain will be put 
 about its sands, the links of which will be railways; freights 
 will circulate between Algiers and Timbuctoo with the speed 
 of lightning ; and the fleets of the Mediterranean will unite with 
 those of the Niger. Touaregs, Kountas, and all unproductive 
 nomads will be thrown back upon the desert, their first home, 
 where they will form an efficient police force, which will protect 
 the routes of the Sahara. 
 
 I picture the city become a centre of European civilisation 
 and science, as it was formerly of Mussulman culture. The 
 reputation of her scholars will again spread from Lake Chad to 
 the mountains of Kong and the shores of the Atlantic, and 
 Timbuctoo will once more be the wealthy and cultured Queen 
 of the Sudan which her distant view now so deceitfully promises 
 her to be.
